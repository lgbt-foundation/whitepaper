# LGBT Token

## Disclaimer

This is an early version of the white paper where we aim to highlight a twofold problem: 1. the global “pink economy” of the LGBT community being neither properly utilized nor clearly defined and 2. nonprofit and charity funds not making it directly into the hands of the most marginalized and oppressed within the LGBT community, then work with the community to create real-world solutions. While this paper highlights key areas and technologies that we feel will provide a crucial foundation for those solutions, this is first and foremost an invitation of participation.

## INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the LGBT<sup>int-1</sup> community has reached an inflection point with an increased number of societies becoming more accepting of and providing equal rights to LGBTs.  The work of many organizations and individuals fighting for LGBT rights is one driving force behind this progress.  Another is that an increasing number of corporations worldwide are now openly supporting diversity and inclusion, understanding that it is fundamental to the operation of their business, and that it is an important matter to their customers.

Progress for the LGBT community has become visible through landmark events, such as:

  * The establishment of marriage equality in 26 countries as far apart as the U.S., Colombia, and South Africa, and soon with Taiwan and Austria to follow;
  * the emergence of openly LGBT politicians in the most senior leadership roles, such as Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, the Prime Minister of Iceland, in 2009 and Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, in 2017;
  * the apologies and rehabilitation issued to victims of anti-LGBT discrimination, such as Justin Trudeau’s $100M pledge to gay purge victims in Canada in 2017 or the Royal pardon of Alan Turing by the Queen of England in 2013;
  * the supportive stance of a large part of the international community of nations toward eliminating remaining anti-LGBT laws and constraining leaders in less progressive countries, most visibly in the United Nations Human Rights Council’s 2011 Resolution on LGBT Rights and General Assembly declaration of LGBT rights, signed by a combined 99 member states, and;
  * the improvements in treatment, cure, prevention, and increased de-stigmatization of HIV/AIDS, such as the FDA approval for Truvada as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 and Prince Harry’s continued call to de-stigmatize HIV in 2017.

But the hard work is far from over. There are still many countries in which openly identifying as LGBT results in massive repercussions or even life-threatening consequences. Even in countries where the legal basis appears equal, the reality is often different—discrimination, bullying and worse are experiences on which nearly every member of the community can give a firsthand report.


### Understanding The Challenges

While there are many complex factors that contribute to discrimination against the LGBT community, one initial but solvable challenge for the community is that both the size of the global community and the power of the worldwide pink economy are neither clearly defined nor understood. It is difficult it can be to quantify exactly the LGBT population, especially since those studies that do exist rely on respondents self-identifying as LGBT or voluntarily reporting their sexual orientation and behavior. Clearly, respondents’ willingness to do this can vary considerably by country, region and age group. It has also been observed that in anti-LGBT environments, members of the LGBT community may frequently be held back from full economic participation (i.e. joining in the labor force or gaining job promotions), which restrains their spending power.
Furthermore, the power of the pink economy has traditionally been clustered around the consumer interests of affluent, white gay men. The full spectrum of sexual orientations and and gender identities with the LGBT community has not, to date, been represented or recognized by corporations on anywhere near the same scale as that group. There is a pressing need for all in the LGBT community to be properly represented, and for their full economic participation to be realized.
As such, the untapped potential of the pink economy is not as forcefully utilized as it could be, if further developed, to help advance equal rights where it can and safeguard the community where it can’t.

> - Christof Wittig, Founder and CEO of Hornet


### Estimating The Size Of The LGBT Community

Public polls and studies carried out by statistics agencies in advanced economies such as the U.S. and the UK have concurred that between 3 and 6 percent of the adult population identify as LGBT. A study carried out by Gallup<sup>int-2</sup> in the U.S. in 2017 found an average of 4.1% of U.S. adults (10 million in total) identified as LGBT, with over 7% of millennial-aged respondents identifying as LGBT. When applied on a global scale to the world’s adult population (16 years+) of 5.3 billion, the 3-7 percentage range gives an LGBT population estimate of between 160 million and 373 million adults globally. Putting that into perspective, if the LGBT community were a country, it would be the third-largest in the world by population, ranking behind only China and India.

### Understanding The Power Of The Pink Economy

The size of the LGBT community translates directly to major global economic impact. In terms of economic power, as a percentage of global GDP per capita, the LGBT community could be said to represent between $2 trillion and $4.2 trillion. Again, if we viewed the LGBT community, at the upper range, this would place the spending power of the pink economy on a level greater than the GDP of Germany. In other words, it would be the world’s 4th-largest economy.<sup>int-3</sup>

`INFOGRAPHIC SHOWING THE ECONOMIC POWER OF THE community IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTRIES`

The disposable income and earning power of the LGBT community continues to grow—at least part of the community. University of Washington’s Marieka Klawitter’s 2014 study determined that lesbians earn a premium of 9% more than heterosexual women. A recent study by Vanderbilt economists Christopher Carpenter and Samuel Eppink discovered that gay men who were employed full-time made on average 10% more than their straight male counterparts.

Only slowly are businesses realizing their loss if not acknowledging this spending power and properly addressing the needs and concerns of the community. More and more industries are just starting to understand that the community can make up significant portion of their income, e.g. up to 10% in the travel industry. The “pink dollar” often looks like any other dollar to them, which is a mistake.  Marketers routinely underestimate the strong loyalty of members of the community and how much it drives purchasing decisions due to a lack of data. While numerous studies have demonstrated that LGBT consumers show loyalty to specific brands that recognize and appeal to them directly, to date, economic activity has only been identifiable in specific sectors of the economy, such as fashion, entertainment, technology, travel, healthcare or financial services. In truth, a much greater pink economy exists and its scale and potential are yet to be fully revealed.

> **It is therefore our mission to utilize blockchain technology with our LGBT Token in order to illustrate the power of the pink economy on a global scale and, by doing so, help the LGBT community tap into that power in order to advance its progressive goals through our LGBT Impact initiative.**


### The Blockchain Innovation

## THE LGBT TOKEN

`PARAGRAPH MISSING`

### 1. Economic Transactions Creating Economic Power

LGBT apps and services, like Hornet and its peers, today already constitute an $100M economy trading in virtual goods and services.<sup>token-1</sup> These activities can be transformed from fiat to cryptocurrencies.  By being able to access LGBT buyers and sellers of goods and services, any business trading with the LGBT community can join this economic realm, whether it is a local promoter selling tickets to an event, or large brands incentivizing community members to test their products and services.  With adoption of the LGBT Token, today’s $100M market can quickly grow as an identifiable and bespoke economy that doesn’t know borders but respects each individual member’s right to both their sexual identity and privacy in three major ways.

> **LGBT apps and services today already constitute an $100M economy trading in virtual goods and services.**

#### Make The Pink Economy Visible

As explained before, only a few companies in a few countries have fully understood that catering to the LGBT consumer is of huge economic benefit. Most of those efforts have been clumsy and are difficult to deploy for smaller suppliers of goods and services, especially if they operate in less liberal countries. Only recently they have started to develop products that cater to the specific needs and concerns of the LGBT community, such as in financial services, hospitality and healthcare. Yet it is safe to assume that there is still a majority of airline executives, for instance, who would not be able to name the percentage of their business stemming from the LGBT community though those same executives could easily break down their customer base by age, provenance, or income.

By participating in the pink economy outright, however, these brands can, in an easy and meaningful manner, directly reach the LGBT community to treat LGBT consumers with the right level of attention they welcome and deserve. The LGBT Foundation will use the publicly available blockchain data to visualize the growth and usage of the LGBT Token to educate businesses and countries to accelerate their interaction with and economic inclusion of the LGBT community.

#### Establish A Global Currency

Today, the pink economy is most visible in endemic businesses such as gay bars, LGBT cruises, or dedicated fashion stores, and digital businesses are confined to a handful of LGBT apps and services such as Grindr, Hornet, or Her. A global LGBT-centric currency would help to empower and connect LGBT businesses around the world, establish an economic identity and shared infrastructure, reduce transaction costs for LGBT community members across all borders, provide protection and support in countries that still suppress LGBT rights and enable the pink economy to not only grow faster, but also give back to the community and support LGBT rights globally.

> **A global LGBT-centric currency would help to empower and connect LGBT businesses around the world**

This is especially important for a community that crosses borders in a literal and metaphorical sense. Instead of relying on existing payment methods, by establishing the LGBT Token as a global currency, the LGBT Foundation can define how fees and increased circulation can be used to help the LGBT community.

Payment Method | Fee Structure | Rewards
-------------- | ------------- | -------
Fiat currency via VISA or similar | approximately 2% of transaction | Varies by Card, personal benefit
Bitcoin | Absolute Fee, >10 USD | none
Ethereum | Absolute Fee, ~1 USD | none
LGBT Token | As Ethereum or lower using off-chain solutions | LGBT Impact

#### Make Token Usage Practical

Blockchain technologies have been around for a long time, yet most cryptocurrencies serve more as speculative assets than practical solutions to change people's lives. We strongly believe that a cryptocurrency is only valid if it is usable. We also believe that HODL-ing is preventing many cryptocurrencies from achieving wider use and acceptance. This is a temporary problem, but one that is still very much the reality at the time of writing of this paper.

To create a healthy velocity of adoption, we plan to streamline the process by moving existing rewards models from the launch partners to LGBT Token. This seamlessly integrated approach will create a user-friendly experience and significantly lower the barrier of entry that currently keeps other cryptocurrencies from being used in a practical and tangible way. By making sure that users have a predictable and reliable source on how to get new tokens they are more likely to spend the tokens.

What’s more, a portion of tokens will be set aside to be used by current and future Foundation members as they see fit to reward users that support the products. While they can be used to purchase services with the apps of the launch partners, the Foundation will actively promote the usage of tokens outside, as well. This includes, but is not limited to:

  * Providing plugins for ecommerce stores to accept LGBT Token as payment
  * Providing devices for locations to accept payments using LGBT Token

Hornet has trusted and longstanding relationships with numerous gay event locations in several major cities. Our launch partners and advisors each bring incredible networks to the Foundation that will help establish the LGBT Token as a regular form of payment. Thus, the LGBT Token will be usable in a real, daily life sort of way. We believe that this is key to the success of the LGBT Token and will help cryptocurrencies in general by providing more real world examples of how it might be used.


### 2. Identity Recognition And Protection

One of the core ideas behind blockchain is to eliminate centralized storage of sensitive data and give the control of this data back to the user. Identity protection has been a major issue for the LGBT community for many years. Establishing a decentralized and secure way of giving every member of the community full control, without the risk of being controlled or abused by governments or corporations, is central to this proposal. LGBT Token will allow each member to not only define what is stored on the blockchain, but also to have full control of that information and who is allowed to access it. This is vital as, without protected yet associated identities, LGBT members cannot act on behalf of the community, either with for-profit or non-profit intent.

#### Community Recognized Yet Individually Protected

Could our mission be accomplished with an existing technology or currency?  No.  We believe that the LGBT community, its members’ identities, the rule of trade, and the allocation of funds to further LGBT Impact causes should be self-governed by the community and cannot be a derivative of a project with a different mission or uncertain prospect of survival.

It cannot be guaranteed that any outside state or corporation, or a foundation with a different mission, would be as good a steward of the privacy of the members of the LGBT community as that community itself. By allowing for unique identification within the LGBT community, yet keeping that information out of reach for governments or corporations, the trust required for the community to adopt LGBT Token is strengthened. This community recognized yet individually protected identification is unique to LGBT Token and key to its rapid mass adoption.

## LAUNCH PARTNERS/TESTIMONIALS

Hornet is the initiator and a founding member of the LGBT Foundation. We are currently talking and working with other high profile applications from the LGBT community and will announce more launch partners shortly. Furthermore, we are building a roster of opinion leaders in the LGBT and cryptocurrency communities to advised the founders on this project and endorse its mission and the proposed implementation.

> **The Foundation invites everyone to contribute to the project**

The Foundation invites everyone to contribute to the project and specifically invites and financially supports launch partners who can help jumpstart the adoption of the Token and the resulting economy. Such partners may be mobile apps, online services or traditional offline, brick-and-mortar businesses like stores or event locations, large brands or individual providers.  Everyone is invited as long as they subscribe to the mission of equal rights and acceptance for the LGBT community and the proposed self-governance.

### Hornet - Gay Social Network

> _“At Hornet, we pursue the mission to give the gay community a digital home.  We strive to foster meaningful connections between its members, to foster collaboration for the greater good, and to give advertisers a brand-safe access to the huge purchasing power of the community”_ - Christof Wittig,Founder and CEO Hornet

Hornet has been a leading innovator in the gay community since 2011 and is the proud original sponsor of this proposal. It was born to create more meaningful ways to connect members of local gay communities, and has since evolved to a social lifestyle app, connecting people, listing events and locations, participating as a media outlet, giving advertisers access to the community, and actively supporting both local communities and global events.

Hornet is the number one gay app in a dozen countries, such as France, Brazil, Taiwan, and Russia, and rapidly growing in many other markets including the United States. Hornet’s network boasts 25 million users, with over 4 million of them monthly active, generating over $10 million USD in revenue this year.

Hornet identifies as much an advocate as a technology leader and is always looking for ways to use technology to empower and protect the members of the community. The engagements range far: support for underprivileged communities like Casa Um, a shelter for LGBT youth in Sao Paulo<sup>launch-1</sup>, or the Voguing community giving identity especially to people of color in Paris<sup>launch-2</sup>; health protection with the KYS feature, an industry first<sup>launch-3</sup>,  or the work in the global inclusion index of the United Nations; educational videos about the effects of machismo on Latinos<sup>launch-4</sup> or research with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health’s efforts to better estimate the size of the LGBT community; trips, local outreach, and international press to highlight situations in countries like Chechnya, Indonesia, or Egypt; support for the gay Gotham Knights Rugby Football Club in New York City or the successful first bid by Hong Kong for an Asian city to host the Gay Games in 2022, and many more.

With this background, Hornet found the recent innovations in fintech to be a perfect boost for the benefit of the whole community. It funded the initiation of the LGBT Token project with substantial budgets and rallied partners and advisors to secure its successful launch and adoption.
