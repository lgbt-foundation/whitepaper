# LGBT Token - WHITE PAPER

> Using **BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY** to **ADVANCE EQUAL RIGHTS AND ACCEPTANCE** for the **LGBT COMMUNITY**

### Legal Disclaimer

`` [[ INSER NEW DISCLAIMER ]] ``

## INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the LGBT<sup>int-1</sup> community has gained recognition with an increased portion of society and governments becoming more accepting of and providing equal rights to LGBTs. The work of many organizations and individuals fighting for LGBT rights is one driving force behind this progress. Another is that a growing number of corporations worldwide are now openly supporting diversity and inclusion, understanding that social responsibility is fundamental to the operation of their business and an important matter to their customers.

Progress for the LGBT community has become visible through landmark events, such as:

  * legal recognition of [marriage equality in 26 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage) including the United States of America, Australia, Colombia, and South Africa, and soon with Taiwan and Austria to follow;
  * the emergence of publicly open LGBT politicians in senior leadership roles, such as Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, the Prime Minister of Iceland, in January 2009 and Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, as of June 2017<sup>int-3</sup>;
  * apologies and restitution issued to victims of anti-LGBT discrimination, such as Justin Trudeau’s USD [100M pledge to homosexual purge victims in Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/100-million-apology-gay-purge-victims-1.4421921) in 2017 or the Royal pardon of Alan Turing by the Queen of England in 2013 followed by a [pardon of all men cautioned or convicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_law) under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts in England and Wales.;
  * the supportive stance of a large part of the international community toward eliminating remaining anti-LGBT laws and constraining leaders in less progressive countries, most visibly in the [United Nations Human Rights Council’s 2011 Resolution on LGBT Rights and General Assembly declaration of LGBT rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_at_the_United_Nations), signed by a combined 99 member states, and;
  * improvements in treatment, cure, prevention, and increased de-stigmatization of HIV/AIDS, such as the [FDA approval for Truvada as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/news/1254/fda-approves-first-drug-for-reducing-the-risk-of-sexually-acquired-hiv-infection) in 2012 and [Prince Harry’s continued call to de-stigmatize HIV](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/prince-harry-calls-for-society-to-embrace-hiv-aids-tests-diana) in 2017.

This hard work is far from over. There are still many countries in which openly identifying as LGBT results in massive repercussions or even life-threatening consequences. Even in countries where the legal basis appears equal, the reality is often different. Discrimination, bullying and worse are experiences on which nearly every member of the community can give a firsthand report. Any of these situations is where the introduction of the LGBT Token can help. But first, we need to understand the challenges that face the global LGBT community in order to understand the benefits it can gain from blockchain technology.


### Understanding the Challenges

There are many complex factors that contribute to discrimination against the LGBT community, from societal legacies like religious fundamentalism to more specialized issues like transgender bathroom laws. However, a few challenges have root causes that we can effectively address right now, as new technologies becomes available.

The most basic and fundamental challenge we aim to solve is an understanding of the size and composition of the global LGBT community. Today the size of the LGBT community is measured from voluntary reporting of sexual orientation and behavior. Clearly, respondents' willingness to do this can vary considerably by country, region and age group. Further challenges happen when a government overlooks the necessity of identifying its own LGBT population, such as the recent decision by the U.S. Census Bureau to [not include questions regarding sexual orientation and gender identity in the 2020 Census](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/18/536484467/census-bureau-found-no-need-for-lgbt-data-despite-4-agencies-requesting-it). This leads to difficulty measuring the exact size of the global LGBT population.

It has also been observed that in anti-LGBT environments, members of the LGBT community may frequently be held back from full economic participation, such as joining in the labor force or gaining job promotions, which restrains their spending power as well as their ability to influence society toward greater equality.

Furthermore, economic analysis has traditionally focused on the consumer interests of affluent, white gay men. The full spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities within the LGBT community has not yet been represented or recognized by corporations on anywhere near the same scale as that initial group. There is a pressing need for all in the LGBT community to be properly represented, and for their full economic participation to be realized. Unfortunately, the economic benefit and progress enjoyed by certain segments of the community have not extended as much to the larger LGBT community, nor on a worldwide scale.

> _"It is now time for the LGBT community to take full control of their destiny. By unleashing the power of technological innovation, we can exert the community's economic might to double down on the rightful pursuit of equal rights and full acceptance."_ <br/> - Christof Wittig, Founder and CEO of Hornet


### Estimating The Size Of The LGBT Community

Public polls and studies carried out by statistics agencies in advanced economies such as the U.S. and the UK have found that between 3 and 7 percent of the adult population identify as LGBT. A [study carried out by Gallup in the U.S. in 2017](http://news.gallup.com/poll/201731/lgbt-identification-rises.aspx) found an average of 4.1% of U.S. adults (10 million in total) identified as LGBT, with over 7% of millennial-aged respondents identifying as LGBT. When applied on a global scale to the world’s adult population (16 years+) of 5.3 billion, the 3-7 percentage range gives an LGBT population estimate of between 160 million and 373 million adults globally. Putting that into perspective, if the LGBT community were a country, it would be the third-largest in the world by population, ranking behind only China and India<sup>int-5</sup>.

That number will only continue to grow. A [2016 study by J Walter Thompson Innovation Group](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/kb4dvz/teens-these-days-are-queer-af-new-study-says) found that only 48% of Generation Z teenagers in the U.S. identify as exclusively heterosexual. The future is no longer a straight line, and as that generation grows up, its spending power and impact on the global economy will only increase.

> **If the LGBT community were a country, it would be the third-largest in the world by population, comparable to the U.S.**

### Understanding The Power Of The Pink Economy

> Taking the 3-7% range, applying it on a global scale and multiplying it by the world average GDP per capita of $12,430, that would result in an LGBT community GDP equivalent of between 2 and 4.6 trillion USD.<br>
However, the LGBT Token could prove fundamental in revealing the true scale of the LGBT population and in helping it achieve the equality and recognition it deserves.<br>
- Peter Jordan, LGBT Consumer Trends Analyst<sup>int-11</sup>

The size of the LGBT community translates directly to major global economic impact. In terms of economic power, as a percentage of global GDP per capita, the LGBT community could account for up to $4.6 trillion. At the upper range, this places the spending power of the pink economy on a level greater than the GDP of Germany. In other words, it could be the world’s 4th-largest economy.

`INFOGRAPHIC SHOWING THE ECONOMIC POWER OF THE community IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTRIES`

In societies where equality has progressed, such as the U.S., the disposable income and earning power of the LGBT community continues to grow. A [2014 study by the University of Washington’s Marieka Klawitter](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irel.12075/abstract) found that lesbians earn a premium of 9% more than heterosexual women. A [recent study by Vanderbilt University economists Christopher Carpenter and Samuel Eppink](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/soej.12233) discovered that gay men who were employed full-time made on average 10% more than their straight male counterparts. There is data that proves tolerance and equality can generate economic growth, and that there is more economic potential that’s still untapped because of oppression and discrimination.

Many businesses are missing out on opportunities by not understanding and taking into account this spending power and properly addressing the needs and concerns of the community. More and more industries are only just starting to understand that the community can make up a significant portion of their revenue. As Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS researcher Erik Lamontagne summed up succinctly, “In simple terms, the more homophobic you are, the more and more it will cost your economy.“<sup>int-14</sup>

To many, the “Pink Dollar” often looks like any other dollar to them, which is a mistake. Due to a lack of data, marketers routinely underestimate the strong loyalty of members of the community and how much it drives purchasing decisions. While numerous studies have demonstrated that LGBT consumers show loyalty to specific brands that recognize and appeal to them directly, economic activity has only been identifiable in specific sectors of the economy, such as fashion, entertainment, technology, travel, healthcare or financial services. In truth, a much greater pink economy exists and its scale and potential are yet to be fully revealed. Harnessing that power in full can help address issues of inequality and discrimination that still plague LGBTs around the world.

> **It is therefore our mission to utilize blockchain technology in order to illustrate the power of the Pink Economy on a global scale and, by doing so, help the LGBT community tap into that power in order to advance its progressive goals.**


#### Inequality And The Status Of The Global LGBT Community

Unfortunately, marginalized subgroups within the LGBT community are still struggling with a unilateral lack of acceptance, directly translating to poor economic status and social inequality, which exclude them from resources and help. Transgender members of the community face the highest amounts of discrimination, with black transgender and gender non-conforming people facing the most severe degree of discrimination and bigotry of all in the U.S. and arguably elsewhere.

> **The growing acceptance of the LGBT community has not yet reached the most marginalized within the community**

The growing acceptance of the LGBT community has not reached the most marginalized within the community and those living in the most oppressive areas of the world. While 26 countries now recognize marriage equality, in 72 countries (37% of United Nation member states) it is [an outright crime to be gay or partake in same-sex sexual activities](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/gay-relationships-still-criminalised-countries-report). In ten countries, the [death penalty is an official legal punishment for being gay](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/13/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death-2/?utm_term=.30d517b3ff0e) or partaking in same-sex activities. In major geographic regions of the world, there is still rampant legal discrimination against and violence toward those in the LGBT community, most notably the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia and Eurasia.

Of United Nations member states, 99 have signed either the UN General Assembly declaration of LGBT rights or the 2011 resolution on LGBT rights by the Human Rights Council. However, 54 members supported a counter-declaration opposing LGBT rights in 2008 and another four dozen members have remained stubbornly neutral and silent on the issue of LGBT rights<sup>int-15</sup>. What’s more, this reluctance to take a clear stand makes it all too easy for these countries to regress in LGBT rights if and when those rights become convenient lightning rod issues for whatever politician or party is in charge (for example, recent developments in both Russia and Nigeria).

## THE LGBT TOKEN

In January 2018, the LGBT Foundation was launched with the goal of achieving equal rights and acceptance for all members of the global LGBT community with the help of blockchain technology. One of the key ingredients to the success of the LGBT Token will be the accumulated experience of the launch partners, its team members, and the wide range of advisers and service providers recruited by the LGBT Foundation, which will issue the Token. The LGBT Foundation will administer the supply and ensure a healthy economic model for the users and partners while also providing the necessary infrastructure to operate a decentralized and autonomous network.

It has planned the upcoming launch of LGBT Token for three key purposes:

 * Enable members to verify and protect their LGBT identities
 * Demonstrate and utilize the economic might of the LGBT community
 * Generate resources to tackle anti-LGBT repression and inequality

` INSERT GRAPHIC TO HIGHLIGHT THE THREE ASPECTS / PILLARS `


### 1. LGBT Identity Management

One of the core ideas behind blockchain, that is, the technology the LGBT Token is built upon, is to eliminate centralized storage of sensitive data and give the control of this data back to the user with additional security. The goal is to have a digital identity that is unique, unhackable and stored in a decentralized environment beyond of the access of governments. It provides a safe and respectful way to honor and protect users’ real identities by establishing a virtual identity that gives full control back to the user. This is of vital importance to the LGBT community as sexual and gender identities define an individual’s membership and sense of self, yet also run the risk of facing discrimination.

> **The idea is to have a digital identity that is unique, unhackable and stored in a decentralized environment, and will be used in a respectful way to honor and protect users' physical identities.**

The LGBT Token identity also gives its members the security in knowing that personal and sensitive data will not be made public, given to third parties, or misused. Hacks like the [Ashley Madison Data Breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach), the [Facebook/Cambridge Analytics data misuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_and_Cambridge_Analytica_data_breach) or the [recent report of Grindr sharing sensitive HIV status data with other companies](https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/grindr-hiv-status-privacy), without the consent of the user, can result in long-term and even dangerous consequences for those affected. For many members of the LGBT community, protecting their identity is a matter of life or death. The Foundation believes that the ownership of their data belongs in the hands of its members.


### 2. LGBT Economy

` GRAPHIC OF A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE OR CLUB WITH A “LGBT TOKENS ACCEPTED” STICKER `

To date, a number of efforts to cater to the LGBT demographic have been clumsy and difficult to deploy for smaller suppliers of goods and services, especially if they operate in less liberal countries. Only recently have industries started to develop products for the specific demand of the LGBT community, such as in financial services, hospitality and healthcare. It would be expected that the majority of corporate executives could provide a breakdown of their customer demographic by reference to age, provenance, or income, but anecdotal evidence confirms that it is unlikely they would be able to specify the percentage of their business that stems from the LGBT community.

By participating in the pink economy with the LGBT Token, however, these companies can, in an easy and meaningful manner, directly reach the LGBT community to treat LGBT consumers with the level of attention they welcome and deserve. Accepting LGBT Token as a method of payment in everyday transactions will enable businesses large and small to demonstrate their affiliation with the LGBT community. Furthermore, they can optimize their LGBT-oriented business by being able to better target this significant customer segment and understand its buying patterns and preferences.

On the flip side, businesses can reward and incentivize the desired behavior of LGBT community members, whether this is encouraging them to generate social media stories, or granting permission for marketing approaches.

Lastly, the LGBT Foundation plans to issue a credit card to showcase the spending behaviour of LGBT Token members and allies using traditional forms of FIAT payment, while linking it to the core concept of the LGBT Foundation: LGBT Impact.

	
### 3. LGBT Impact

> **LGBT Impact is the inherent and powerful funding mechanism for causes of importance for the LGBT community in their quest to achieve equal rights and acceptance.**

LGBT Impact, the branch of the LGBT Foundation devoted to social causes, will provide a powerful funding mechanism for important causes of the LGBT community. To that end, the LGBT Foundation plans to hold an annualized Token reserve specifically for LGBT Impact. Given the proposed regularity and amount of LGBT Tokens reserved for LGBT Impact, we believe it has the potential to be the largest dedicated LGBT social responsibility program in the world.

In the future, we envision that LGBT Impact will allow donations to be matched to specific projects or members with LGBT identity, creating a foundation of grassroots governance and direction of LGBT Impact's efforts. We propose to explore funding from major non-profit organizations to match LGBT Impact’s grants, and find other new and innovative ways to help LGBT causes both large and small, anywhere around the globe. In both cases, the firepower of LGBT Impact can be amplified while utilizing the community and the advisory board of the Foundation to allocate, supervise, and govern the funds.


#### Example LGBT Impact: Chechnya

` Chechen PICTURE `
> Fig: Chechen police have been engaged in systematic entrapment of gay men since 2017. The community, supported by Hornet, the market leader for gay apps in Russia, has been shedding light on this deprivation of rights and harm inflicted on LGBTs, and has helped to evacuate up to 70 men to safety, possibly saving their lives<sup>impact-1</sup> (Photo by Valya Egorshin/NurPhoto via Getty Images).

As an example, a recent wave of detention and torture of gay men in Chechnya<sup>impact-2</sup> beginning in February 2017 became so outrageous that it attracted the attention of and action by activists and financial supporters. As a market leader for gay apps in Russia, Hornet was at the forefront of this effort, providing extensive coverage and education about the situation. But it also provided on the ground and behind-the-scenes work to evacuate up to 70 Chechen men to safety. Unfortunately it was a limited effort due to funding constraints, as it could have been extended to many more thousands of abused members of the LGBT community there.

Not all such acts of oppression draw similar levels of attention, but remain in the shadows. A response today could consist of media coverage, possible and likely partisan social media outrage, as well as grassroots initiatives supported by individual donations or occasionally larger grants. In the future, the LGBT Foundation envisions that any such incidents where the rights of LGBT people are oppressed should be clearly identifiable - who are these victims, how many are there, and how can we reach them without endangering them? By doing so, the Foundation will be able to allocate and quickly transfer funds in order to make an immediate and meaningful difference on the ground.

> **The LGBT Foundation would aim to make sure that emergency Tokens are available immediately. This could literally save lives.**

It is of value to put a sad face on articles reporting such prosecutions on social media since awareness is a key prerequisite for change. However, the LGBT Foundation believes that it is more effective to, for instance, transfer within hours USD 20,000 worth of funding directly and promptly to the victims, allowing them to organize transportation and security to reach safer pastures before getting injured or worse.

The LGBT Foundation would make sure that such emergency Tokens are:

 * available immediately,
 * that further Tokens can be mobilized quickly,
 * that these Tokens can be transferred across borders without hassle or undue cost,
 * and that they reach exactly the right targets without risks of compromising identities or unscrutinized embezzlement of such funds.

We imagine if that this entire process, from an initial call for help right up to purchasing plane tickets or travel fare to evacuate, could be achieved using LGBT Token, one’s sexual and gender identity and purchases would be protected and private throughout. It will, quite literally, save lives, but it’s just one of the examples by which we could illustrate the numerous ways in which LGBT Impact can make a tangible difference in the lives of LGBT community members, no matter where they are.


#### Network Accelerator Program

The LGBT Foundation will establish a Network Accelerator Program to help businesses adopt the Token. The Foundation will provide grants of Tokens reserved to jumpstart launch partnerships and broader consumer adoption. A portion of the Tokens will be set aside to be used by current and future LGBT Foundation members as they see fit to reward users that support their products and services. While the Tokens can be used to purchase services, for example, using the apps of the launch partners, the LGBT Foundation will also actively promote and enable other usage of Tokens.

This includes, but is not limited to:

 * Providing plugins for e-commerce stores to accept LGBT Token as payment
 * Providing devices for locations to accept payments using LGBT Token

Hornet Networks brings to the LGBT Foundation trusted and longstanding relationships with numerous event locations in several major cities. In addition, the LGBT Foundation launch partners and advisers each bring well-established networks to the LGBT Foundation that will help help lay the foundations for the LGBT Token to become a regular form of payment.

The LGBT Token has a strong economic utility to each party engaging in an underlying transaction. With the support of strong launch partners, the creation of Network Acceleration Program, and intuitive user and application programming interfaces, the LGBT Token will be rapidly adopted and utilized in everyday life.


### Why make the LGBT Token a cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies have several high-level benefits that are tailored toward the core missions we hold. These benefits include:

#### Decentralization

As mentioned above, the LGBT Token is built using the protection of blockchain. The decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency is therefore immune to centralized or government control. Furthermore, it’s free of discrimination - everyone with an internet connection and phone can access cryptocurrency.


#### A global form of payment

The LGBT community already identifies as a global community. There are few communities with so strong an affiliation to common causes across borders. Traveling is an important aspect for many members, whether to leave their country of oppression or to engage with their community abroad. LGBT Tokens are intended to be used as a global form of payment for online services as well as at brick-and-mortar stores, travel destinations and other industries.

#### LGBT Identity and Pseudonymity

> By putting *encrypted* identity on the blockchain, there is less fraud and people can trust a decentralized system through asymmetric encryption.

The pseudonymity of cryptocurrency and blockchain allow users to protect their physical identities while giving them credibility and authority within the system. By putting encrypted identity on the blockchain, there is less fraud and people can trust that their information will stay safe and secure in the decentralized system.


#### Voting & Decentralized Governance

The governance of the LGBT Foundation, as well as the distribution of funds for the LGBT Impact program, will be organized by community voting. The LGBT community is a grassroots movement, so the control of the direction of this new technology should be shaped by listening to those directly affected by it.


#### Security

The information stored in the blockchain is encrypted and maintained by a large network of participants that ensures its consistency. No one person can get unauthorized access or is able to manipulate or remove information without the consent of the personal owner of that information. This prevents governments and organizations from demanding, hacking or otherwise obtaining this information, an especially critical safeguard in countries where the LGBT community faces repercussions and victimization.

This paper focuses on the issues that the LGBT Foundation strives to solve. A pink paper with further details exploring the exact technical solution has been released separately and with the input of the crypto community. We’d be happy to provide it upon request if you’d like to learn more about the technical aspects of the LGBT Token.


## LAUNCH PARTNERS

### Initial Sponsorship by Hornet - Gay Social Network

> _“At Hornet, we pursue the mission to give the gay community a digital home. We strive to create meaningful connections between its members, to foster collaboration for the greater good, and to give advertisers a brand-safe access to the huge purchasing power of the community.”_ - Christof Wittig, Hornet Founder and CEO

`[SMALL HORNET LOGO]` Hornet has been a leading innovator in the gay community since 2011 and is the proud original sponsor of the LGBT Foundation and Token. It was born to create more meaningful ways to connect members of local gay communities, and has since evolved to a social lifestyle app by connecting people, listing events and locations, participating as a media outlet, giving advertisers access to the community, and actively supporting both local communities and global events.

Hornet is the number one gay app in a dozen countries, such as France, Brazil, Taiwan, and Russia, and rapidly growing in many other markets including the United States. Hornet’s network boasts 25 million users, with over 4 million of them active monthly, generating over $10 million USD in revenue this year.

Hornet identifies as much of an advocate as it does a technology leader and is always looking for ways to use technology to empower and protect the members of the community. The engagements have included:

 * support for underprivileged communities like Casa Um, a shelter for LGBT youth in Sao Paulo<sup>launch-1</sup>, and
 * the Voguing community giving identity especially to people of color in Paris<sup>launch-2</sup>;
 * health protection with the Know Your Status (KYS) feature, an industry first<sup>launch-3</sup>;
 * educational videos about the effects of machismo on Latinos<sup>launch-4</sup> and
 * research with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health's efforts to better estimate the size of the LGBT community;
 * trips, local outreach, and international press to highlight situations in countries like Chechnya, Indonesia, or Egypt;
 * support for the gay Gotham Knights Rugby Football Club in New York City and
 * the successful first bid by Hong Kong for an Asian city to host the Gay Games in 2022, and many more.

As a result, Hornet is the only private company to be invited as Founding Member of the United Nations Global HIV Prevention Coalition, side by side with 30 nations and NGOs such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

With this background, Hornet found that the recent innovations in blockchain could offer huge benefits for the whole LGBT community. It funded the initiation of the LGBT Token project with substantial budgets and rallied partners and advisers to secure its successful launch.

### AN OPEN LETTER FOR PARTICIPATION

To whom it may concern,

On behalf of the newly formed LGBT Foundation, I would like to invite you to join us in our mission to empower the LGBT community by contributing to the planned LGBT Token project, designed to help advance equal rights and acceptance for the LGBT community around the globe.

The LGBT Foundation’s Token Sale will take place in the first quarter of 2018, with the aim of using the power and potential of blockchain to raise funds and allocate cryptocurrency Tokens to private investors and individual participants. A blockchain-based LGBT Token will establish a shared economic identity and infrastructure, which we can harness to not only empower and connect LGBT businesses around the world, but also help protect LGBT community members’ identities in a safe and secure environment.

Blockchain technology helps us reach this goal by allowing users to make transactions without anyone being able to trace the participants. Despite the anonymity, it remains inherently secure as the information is held on a network of computing devices, which collectively store and verify changes. This means blockchain can facilitate and authenticate payments and record the entire history of exchange, without either party needing to reveal their identity – a revolutionary step in the LGBT community’s fight for equal rights and acceptance.

As founder and CEO of Hornet Networks, I’ve seen firsthand the LGBT community’s economic might, and the potential it offers to help local communities, organizations, and individuals in their quest for equality and acceptance in society. Although we at Hornet have set up the LGBT Foundation, our aim is that it will evolve into a self-governing body run by and for members of the LGBT community to direct its activities, resources and members for the benefit of the international LGBT community.

In my professional career as a serial entrepreneur and investor, nothing has been more fulfilling than working every day on Hornet’s mission to give the gay community a digital home that fosters meaningful connections and helps to drive acceptance.

The LGBT Foundation is a logical next step, much bigger than me or Hornet, or even my fellow gay men, but for the entire LGBT community. As a gay man, a tech entrepreneur with a strong open source background and a Stanford MBA, I feel obliged to call out the immense potential of blockchain, and the near perfect fit for our needs.

Today marks the start of a new phase in which we aim to secure that every LGBT person has the same opportunities and privileges as anyone else. In the future we will use resources from the LGBT Foundation to actively support members of the LGBT community in instances where they are vulnerable, distressed, or suffering from oppression or inequality, from financial assistance to support political activism to logistical and operational support. And we will finally make the elusive economic power of the Pink Economy tangible and usable to further our rights and acceptance.

That’s why I would like to call on the global LGBT community, its allies, and related interest groups to get involved with the LGBT Foundation.

Please visit [link]www.lgbt-token.org[/link] to learn more and join this major effort to make a meaningful difference for the LGBT community.

Yours Sincerely,<br>

_Christof Wittig_<br>
LGBT Foundation President<br>
Hornet Networks Founder and CEO

  * Footnote int-1 used twice on purpose
  * Each H1 headline (UPCASE headlines) start a new page, ideally in a visually distinguishable fashion
  * Each blockquote is either a quote when in _italic_ or a pullquote when **bold**
  * All images need to list the source and may have a caption
  * The team pages (team, advisor, partner) should be in a grid format, please grab images from linkedin. We should include linkedin and twitter links where applicable
  * Please keep the "advisers to be announced" section in there and do not list the advisers as of now. The list of advisers is merely to collect the data
  * Footnotes are to be on the page where they have been referenced and are to be numbered only. We use per-paragraph named footnotes like _int-1_ for convenience. At the end, the footnotes should be numerical only.
  * Please add an element to the footer of the layout that links to the exact version of the white paper on github, ideally as Version number and hash. We will use tags accordingly: e.g. Version 0.5 (834a4fe) with `834a4fe` being a link to github (https://github.com/lgbt-foundation/white paper/commit/834a4fecfbe4369f478134ae15f1a540cfa274b2)
  * Please add a twitter and a telegram logo on the cover and the last page and link them to our official channels
