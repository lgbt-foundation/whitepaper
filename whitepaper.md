## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The LGBT Foundation launched on January 12, 2018 with the aim to harness the power of blockchain technology to deliver equality for the global LGBT community<sup>exec-1</sup>. The LGBT Foundation will tokenize the power of the LGBT economy ("Pink Economy") to support three principal goals:

- Enable members to verify and protect their LGBT identities (to create a decentralized economy of trust and enable encrypted full-or-partial identity verification on the blockchain);
- Demonstrate and utilize the economic might of the LGBT community while reducing market frictions by enabling micropayments to allow pay-per-use digital features in the digital app economy (for example give a user more features as long as he stakes his tokens), and enable user empowerment by giving a user tokens if they share content that gets a lot of likes or attention (sharing advertising revenue)
- Generate resources to tackle anti-LGBT discrimination, oppression and inequality - by allocating a percentage of LGBT Tokens as they're spent to LGBT Impact Causes to distribute to causes nominated and voted for by the community (in proportion to their reputation and the number of tokens they hold).

<span style="color:red">**ALEX: I added more Token context**</span>

**LGBT Tokens**
In the first half of 2018, the LGBT Foundation will conduct a Token Sale to raise 60,000 Ethereum (ETH) for building the required infrastructure described in this paper. It will allocate 20% of its available cryptocurrency tokens (LGBT Tokens) to participants in the initial Token Sale. A further 40% of the tokens will be put in reserve governed by the non-profit LGBT Foundation to finance future platform development. The remaining Tokens will be allocated to integration partners (10%) and the Network Accelerator Program (10%) to seed the network and incentivise Token adoption.  The team (15%) and advisors (5%) will be allocated the remaining tokens under lock-up vesting periods which aligns incentives.

<span style="color:red">**ALEX: I edited the governance section - the buzzword is "onchain governance". We already say in the Governance section below "this open governance model" - we should explicitly say that governance is on-chain. We can still effectively retain control since we'll have most of the tokens but when I read "it will allocate 20% and the rest will be governed by the foundation.... to remunerate contributors", I get nervous as an investor. Adding "onchain governance" would make me feel less nervous as an investor. We should also mention the other splits if we mention the 20% since the 80% implied by the 20% is massive - I think we should say something like my edit showing the split. Rather than saying "the remaining Tokens will be governed by the Foundation", let's say how the remaining are split. I would also consider raising the percent - Clearpoll allocated 70% to crowdfund investors, AllPublicArt allocated 50%, Civic allocated 33%. Haven't seen any allocations below 30%. **</span>

**Making the Pink Economy visible**
If the LGBT community were a country, it would be the world's 4th-largest economy with a GDP of USD 4.6 trillion<sup>exec-2</sup>. However, the power of the Pink Economy is often underestimated. The LGBT Foundation will make this global economic muscle tangible and visible - by establishing a LGBT-centric digital asset to allow borderless transactions and exchange among an already global community while safeguarding its members' identities.

**Tackling anti-LGBT repression and inequality**
Furthermore, resources from the LGBT Foundation will be allocated on an ongoing basis to actively support members of the LGBT community in instances where they are vulnerable, distressed, or suffering from inequality. This can include financial assistance to support political activism, mobilization of crowdsourcing, as well as logistical and operational support.

**Driving adoption of LGBT Tokens in everyday transactions**
Beyond the non-profit use of the Token, the economically more significant use of the Token is to drive its adoption as a method of payment in everyday transactions across all businesses. From the outset, Hornet Networks, the instigator of the LGBT Foundation, and its launch partners will accept the LGBT Token as a means of payment for their services. Businesses can thus demonstrate their affiliation with the LGBT community and optimize their LGBT-oriented business by being able to better target this important customer segment, which, depending on the industry, can constitute a large yet elusive element of their corporate income.

The LGBT Foundation has established a Network Accelerator Program to help businesses adopt the Token, and dedicated grants worth 10% of the issued Tokens to seed the network and get widespread distribution of tokens. For example, Hornet could allocate tokens to all of its users and enable users to pay for features using tokens or earn tokens by posting content that gets a lot of attention (directly rewarding the user for publishing that content if they choose to allow it to be monetised). Another example might be granting stores tokens to used as discounts for in-store payments denominated in LGBT Token. A range of practical measures - such as providing plug-ins for e-commerce stores or devices in physical locations that accept LGBT Tokens as payment - together with clear LGBT-Token branded signage showing that the store is LGBT friendly - will also further accelerate its adoption. 
<span style="color:red"> **ALEX: I added more token context. Might be too Hornet but I think it's clear that it's just one example. **</span>

**Invitation to get involved with the LGBT Foundation**
With backgrounds in enriching the LGBT community through innovative uses of technology, Hornet Networks and the launch team are uniquely positioned to act as catalysts to unlock the potential of the Pink Economy with blockchain.

To achieve its stated goals, the LGBT Foundation is inviting and seeking involvement and contributions from individuals and organizations across the LGBT community, crypto community and beyond to join these efforts and shape the future of the LGBT Foundation together.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

` WILL BE ADDED AUTOMATICALLY `

## INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the LGBT community<sup>int-1</sup> has reached an inflection point with an increased number of society segments and governments becoming more accepting of and providing equal rights to LGBTs. The work of many organizations and individuals fighting for LGBT rights is one driving force behind this progress. Another is that an increasing number of corporations worldwide are now openly supporting diversity and inclusion, understanding that social responsibility is fundamental to the operation of their business, and that it is an important matter to their customers.

Progress for the LGBT community has become visible through landmark events, such as:

  * legal recognition of marriage equality in 26 countries including the United States of America, Australia, Colombia, and South Africa, and soon with Taiwan and Austria to follow<sup>int-2</sup>;
  * the emergence of publicly open LGBT politicians in senior leadership roles, such as JÃ³hanna SigurÃ°ardÃ³ttir, the Prime Minister of Iceland, in January 2009 and Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, as of June 2017<sup>int-3</sup>;
  * apologies and restitution issued to victims of anti-LGBT discrimination, such as Justin Trudeauâ€™s USD 100M pledge to homosexual purge victims in Canada in 2017<sup>int-4</sup> or the Royal pardon of Alan Turing by the Queen of England in 2013<sup>int-5</sup>;
  * the supportive stance of a large part of the international community toward eliminating remaining anti-LGBT laws and constraining leaders in less progressive countries, most visibly in the United Nations Human Rights Councilâ€™s 2011 Resolution on LGBT Rights and General Assembly declaration of LGBT rights, signed by a combined 99 member states<sup>int-6</sup>, and;
  * improvements in treatment, cure, prevention, and increased de-stigmatization of HIV/AIDS, such as the FDA approval for Truvada as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012<sup>int-7</sup> and Prince Harryâ€™s continued call to de-stigmatize HIV in 2017<sup>int-8</sup>.

However, there is still a long road ahead.

This hard work is far from over. There are still many countries in which openly identifying as LGBT results in massive repercussions or even life-threatening consequences. Even in countries where the legal basis appears equal, the reality is often different. Discrimination, bullying and worse are experiences on which nearly every member of the community can give a firsthand report.

### Understanding the Challenges

There are many complex factors that contribute to discrimination against the LGBT community, from societal legacies like religious fundamentalism to more specialized issues like transgender bathroom laws. However, a few challenges have root causes that we can effectively address today, as new technologies becomes available.

The most fundamental and initial challenge we aim to solve is an insufficient definition and understanding of the size of the global LGBT community. The size of the LGBT community is measured from voluntary reporting of sexual orientation and behavior. Clearly, respondents' willingness to do this can vary considerably by country, region and age group. This leads to difficulty measuring the exact size of the global LGBT population.

It has also been observed that in anti-LGBT environments, members of the LGBT community may frequently be held back from full economic participation (i.e. joining in the labor force or gaining job promotions), which restrains their spending power as well as their ability to influence society towards greater equality.

Furthermore, the economic analysis has traditionally focused on the consumer interests of affluent, white gay men. The full spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities with the LGBT community has not, to date, been represented or recognized by corporations on anywhere near the same scale as that initial group. There is a pressing need for all in the LGBT community to be properly represented, and for their full economic participation to be realized as a collective.

While Western societies have made good progress on recognizing the rights of people with differing sexual orientation by enacting legislation and corporate social responsibility, that benefit and progress has not extended as much to the larger LGBT community and on a worldwide scale.

> _"It is now time for the LGBT community to take full control of their destiny. By unleashing the power of technological innovation, we can exert the community's economic might to double down on the rightful pursuit of equal rights and full acceptance."_ <br/> - Christof Wittig, Founder and CEO of Hornet

### Estimating The Size Of The LGBT Community

Public polls and studies carried out by statistics agencies in advanced economies such as the U.S. and the UK have found that between 3 and 6 percent of the adult population identify as LGBT. A study carried out by Gallup<sup>int-9</sup> in the U.S. in 2017 found an average of 4.1% of U.S. adults (10 million in total) identified as LGBT, with over 7% of millennial-aged respondents identifying as LGBT. When applied on a global scale to the worldâ€™s adult population (16 years+) of 5.3 billion, the 3-7 percentage range gives an LGBT population estimate of between 160 million and 373 million adults globally. Putting that into perspective, if the LGBT community were a country, it would be the third-largest in the world by population, ranking behind only China and India<sup>int-10</sup>.

> **If the LGBT community were a country, it would be the third-largest in the world by population, comparable to the U.S.**

`INFOGRAPHIC SHOWING THE SIZE OF THE community IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTRIES`

### Understanding The Power Of The Pink Economy

> Taking the 3-7% range, applying it on a global scale and multiplying it by the world average GDP per capita of $12,430, that would result in an LGBT community GDP equivalent of between 2 and 4.6 trillion USD.<br>
However, the LGBT Token could prove fundamental in revealing the true scale of the LGBT population and in helping it achieve the equality and recognition it deserves.<br>
- Peter Jordan, LGBT Consumer Trends Analyst<sup>int-11</sup>

The size of the LGBT community translates directly to major global economic impact. As mentioned above, in terms of economic power, as a percentage of global GDP per capita, the LGBT community could account for up to $4.6 trillion. At the upper range, this places the spending power of the Pink Economy on a level greater than the GDP of Germany. In other words, it could be the worldâ€™s 4th-largest economy.


`INFOGRAPHIC SHOWING THE ECONOMIC POWER OF THE community IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTRIES`

In societies where equality has progressed, such as the U.S., the disposable income and earning power of the LGBT community continues to grow. A 2014 study by the University of Washingtonâ€™s Marieka Klawitter found that lesbians earn a premium of 9% more than heterosexual women<sup>int-12</sup>. A recent study by Vanderbilt University economists Christopher Carpenter and Samuel Eppink discovered that gay men who were employed full-time made on average 10% more than their straight male counterparts<sup>int-13</sup>. There is therefore the authorsâ€™ belief that tolerance and equality can generate economic growth, and that there is more economic potential thatâ€™s still untapped because of oppression and discrimination.

Many businesses are missing out on opportunities by not understanding and taking into account this spending power and properly addressing the needs and concerns of the community. More and more industries are only just starting to understand that the community can make up a significant portion of their revenue, for example up to 10% in the travel industry. As Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS researcher Erik Lamontagne summed up succinctly, â€œIn simple terms, the more homophobic you are, the more and more it will cost your economy.â€<sup>int-14</sup> To many, the â€œpink dollarâ€ often looks like any other dollar to them, which is a mistake.  Marketers routinely underestimate the strong loyalty of members of the community and how much it drives purchasing decisions due to a lack of data. While numerous studies have demonstrated that LGBT consumers show loyalty to specific brands that recognize and appeal to them directly, to date, economic activity has only been identifiable in specific sectors of the economy, such as fashion, entertainment, technology, travel, healthcare or financial services. In truth, a much greater Pink Economy exists and its scale and potential are yet to be fully revealed.

> **It is therefore our mission to utilize blockchain technology with our LGBT Token in order to illustrate the power of the Pink Economy on a global scale and, by doing so, help the LGBT community tap into that power in order to advance its progressive goals.**


#### Inequality And The Status Of The Global LGBT Community

As outlined earlier in the introduction, there have been a number of positive developments for the LGBT community in recent years. Nevertheless, marginalized subgroups within the LGBT community are still struggling with a unilateral lack of acceptance, directly translating to poor economic status and social inequalities, excluding them from resources and help. Transgender members of the community face the highest amounts of discrimination, and recent studies have shown that black transgender and gender non-conforming people face the most severe degree of discrimination and bigotry of all, certainly in the U.S. and arguably elsewhere.

> **The growing acceptance of the LGBT community has not yet reached the most marginalized within the community**

In a breakout report from the National Center for Transgender Equalityâ€™s U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS)<sup>inequ-1</sup>, which aggregated data from 27,715 respondents nationwide, 796 black or African-American transgender or gender non-identifying respondents clarified the stark reality facing them. Among the findings for this group, the report found that:

  * 20% of respondents were unemployed, twice the rate of black people in the U.S. population and four times that of the U.S. population overall
  * 42% had been homeless at some point in their lives, compared to 30% of the USTS sample overall
  * 38% were living in poverty, compared to 24% of black people in the U.S. population
  * 53% have been sexually assaulted at one point in their lives, compared to 47% of all USTS respondents
  * 6.7% were HIV+, nearly five times the rate of the USTS sample and 20 times the U.S. population

The growing acceptance of the LGBT community has not yet reached the most marginalized within the community and those living in the most oppressive areas of the world. While 26 countries now recognize marriage equality, in 72 countries (37% of United Nation member states) it is an outright crime to be gay or partake in same-sex sexual activities.<sup>inequ-2</sup> In ten countries, the death penalty is an official legal punishment for being gay or partaking in same-sex activities<sup>inequ-3</sup>.

` INSERT TWO GRAPHICS - ONE WORLDMAP LIKE ON WIKIPEDIA AND ONE WITH THE SIZE OF PEOPLE IN SAFE, UNDEFINED AND DANGEROUS ZONES `

In major geographic regions of the world, there is still rampant legal discrimination against and violence toward those in the LGBT community, most notably the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia and Eurasia. Of United Nations member states, 99 have signed either the UN General Assembly declaration of LGBT rights or the 2011 resolution on LGBT rights by the Human Rights Council. However, 54 members supported a counter-declaration opposing LGBT rights in 2008 and another 44 members have remained stubbornly neutral and silent on the issue of LGBT rights<sup>inequ-4</sup>. Whatâ€™s more, this reluctance to take a clear stand makes it all too easy for these countries to regress in LGBT rights if and when those rights become convenient lightning rod issues for whatever politician or party is in charge (for example, the recent developments in both Russia and Nigeria).

The LGBT Foundation is a socially-minded company, committed to galvanizing the LGBT community by creating a real "pink dollar" economic ecosystem and through its corporate social responsibility program, LGBT Impact.

## The LGBT Token

> **We will establish the LGBT Foundation to issue and govern the LGBT Token.

The LGBT Token is a cryptographic asset that follows the ERC-20 standard [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md] for smart contracts running on the public Ethereum blockchain. 

Blockchain technology offers new forms of technical innovation for the greater good of the LGBT community. Its decentralized nature also ties into the decentralized and grassroots movement that launched the overall LGBT acceptance movement in the first place. And while there are benefits and challenges with the current state of blockchain technologies, they do present untold opportunities to innovate and use technology for good. 

Reserach on the blockchain is moving incredibly fast and while we have already conducted an extensive 3 month technical feasibility study and implemented initial smart contracts, the details discussed below (including the use of the Ethereum blockchain) are subject to change during the course of development.

### Why issue a token?

Crypto-currencies have several high-level benefits including:
1. Decentralized trust - no centralized or government control - "consensus" algorithms require the collective

2. No discrimination - everyone with an internet connection and phone can access crypto-currency

3. Much faster and cheaper transactions

4. By putting *encrypted* identity on the blockchain, there is less fraud and people can trust a decentralized trustless system through asymmetric encryption [Simmons, 1979]. Voting on the blockchain is public and untamperable (while still privacy preserving) https://www.princeton.edu/~rblee/ELE572Papers/CSurveys_SymmAsymEncrypt-simmons.pdf]

There are clear technical reasons for issuing LGBT-Token:

#### Cheap Micropayments

The blockchain, especially in conjunction with off-chain master-node transactions, brings the promise of much faster and much cheaper transaction fees than are typical when paying by credit card. 

LGBT Token can be used for payment at brick-and-mortar stores by showing the cashier a QR-code of your public wallet key. You can earn tokens for being a loyal customer in the form of discounted purchases where your loyalty is securely and privately stored on the LGBT blockchain. 

Apps that implement the LGBT Token will be able to charge micropayments for unlocking app features that are otherwise usually packaged as subscriptions. Being forced to pay a minimum transaction fee of at least 2% and usually a minimum absolute amount like 0.01 USD leaves no room to charge for single uses of features. 

Conversely, users can be rewarded micropayments for example as revenue share for any likes generated from content that they created. This aligns incentives since they are monetarily motivated to generate content but have the option to opt-out, for example while they stake a certain number of LGBT tokens. Staking can also be used to provide features such as boosting a profile's exposure in a social media app context while that user is staking tokens.

> Each (micro-) payment is split into 3 parts when the owner of the wallet issues a paymet:
1. The transaction fee that goes to the PoS nodes (see below)
2. A LGBT-Impact donation that goes into the LGBT-Impact smart contract 
3. The net amount sent to the recipient


#### Reputation-Linked Master Nodes

Proof-of-Stake (POS) [Buterin, 2017*] an alternative consensus algorithm to the more common Proof-of-Work (POW) where miners (usually using GPUs or more likely ASICs) solve complex math problems to confirm blocks. POW is a "race to the bottom" in the sense that the more miners you have on the network, the cheaper your marginal cost is for an additional miner (since your scale has likely given you access to cheap electricity, bulk miner unit discounts, etc). It is also a terrible waste of energy. Bitcoin mining can be simply viewed as a process that converts electricity into BTC tokens. 

Instead of using Proof-of-Work electricity is wasted, one can use Proof-of-Stake where each miner runs a very low computation algorithm where the network is secured by requiring the "miners" to "stake" tokens. In fact they are not "miners" at all because in PoS there is no block reward - the miners take the transaction fees in proportion to their stake and are punished by burning some or all of their staked tokens. 

Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Founder said in a tweet[Buterin b., 2017] on 12 December 2017, "
>Right now my favorite token model is OMG-style staking tokens. Reasons:
> * Not a medium-of-exchange token
> * Clear valuation model (expected discounted future tx fees minus node operation cost)
> * Requires running node to get returns, not passive income (so more legally defensible)

There are a number of game-theoretic reasons why PoS is preferable to PoW. There are "economic incentives to discourage centralized cartels and anti-centralization incentives to discourage cartels from forming in the first place". [Buterin, 2017]

The Proof-of-Stake idea can be extended to include masternodes that can manage off-chain transactions that use Merkle trees to sync cross-node state [Merkle, 1982]. Masternodes fulfill the same critical role as miners: they secure the network. Retailers that accept LGBT-Token will run LGBT-Masternodes to get near-instant block confirmations with a minimum required stake that is linked to your reputation as a sort of deposit against attempting to double spend or otherwise engage in malicious activity towards the network. Users and non-merchants can themselves run masternodes if they would like put up staking tokens in exchange for earning fees to secure the network. The LGBT-Foundation will run nodes to match at least 20% of MasterNodes in the network. 

These PoS tokens are essentially withdrawn from the monetary supply when they are being staked.

#### Decentralized

The LGBT Token is built on top of a decentralized ledger and while some partners might choose to implement off-chain solutions for performance reasons, the decentralized nature of the Ethereum network is important as an independent and immutable trust layer between the participating parties. The LGBT Token is explicitly intended as a digital asset that can be used across apps and businesses. 

#### Voting & Decentralized Governance

The LGBT-Impact smart contract receives a proportion of each transaction. This 'donation transaction fee' is set by the masternodes as a weighted average of each masternode's proposal amount, weighted by the amount each masternode has staked. The 'donation transaction fee' will never be 0 since the LGBT-Foundation will always run masternodes and will never vote for a 0 donation transaction fee allocation to the LGBT-Impact smart contract.

The LGBT-Impact smart contract allocates funds to various charitable and pro-LGBT developmental causes. The LGBT Foundation and the community nominate candidate charities and causes and the funds are allocated in proportion to the number of votes received. Unlike the "donation transaction fee" vote which is only voted on by the masternodes, the LGBT-Impact allocation vote is open to all users. The weight of a vote depends on reputation and the number of tokens (capped at a minority amount - to be determined - so that no user's voice can outweigh any other's by so much as to drown it out. Every vote counts at least something and more votes are allocated to well behaving users who are invested in securing the platform).

The recently proposed (2017/10/02) ERC-725 standard, https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725] suggests new standards to enable voting - including delegated voting - to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is already possible to implement a voting contract using the ERC-20 standard and this is the course we will take for now. Implementing "delegated voting" is further down the roadmap but it is feasible that users may nominate a reputable member of the community or third party charity - and let them proxy the user's "delegated vote".

#### LGBT Identity and Pseudonymity

Creating a trusted and decentralized identity layer that can be used across the launch partners and others allows a reputation system where each participating party can record the reputations of each within their ecosystem or community and make that information available for others. The pseudonymity allows users to protect their physical identities while giving them credibility and authority within the system.

#### Security

The information stored in the blockchain is encrypted and maintained by a large network of participants that ensures its consistency. Not one actor can get unauthorized access or is able to manipulate or remove information without the consent of the owner. This prevents governments and organizations from demanding, hacking or otherwise obtaining this information, an especially critical safeguard in countries where the LGBT community faces repercussions and victimization.

#### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts enable credible transactions without a verification of a third party. The use cases for smart contracts for the LGBT Token are versatile and reach far beyond the standard transfer of Tokens between individuals. We see a number of unique opportunities for the three different pillars of the LGBT Token that will be publicly available on GitHub.

For example,
- the user can define if additional demographic or identity information can be transmitted anonymously with merchants for marketing purposes;
- escrow services for purchases that will be released once the service is provided; and
- funds sent via LGBT Impact can be bound to acquire goods and services only from whitelisted wallets of specific merchants and organizations to eliminate unwanted spending of LGBT Impact funds.

## Goals of the LGBT Token

By tokenizing the Pink Dollar, the LGBT Foundation will support three principal goals:

- enable members to verify and protect their LGBT identities;
- demonstrate and utilize the economic might of the LGBT community;
- generate resources to tackle anti-LGBT repression and inequality;


` INSERT GRAPHIC TO HIGHLIGHT THE THREE ASPECTS / PILLARS `

### 1. LGBT Identity Management

One of the core ideas behind blockchain is to eliminate centralized storage of sensitive data and give the control of this data back to the user, in addition to increased security. Sexual and gender identities are at the heart of the LGBT community since they define an individualâ€™s membership and sense of self.

> **The idea is to have a digital identity that is unique, unhackable and stored in a decentralized environment, and will be used in a respectful way to honor and protect users' physical identities.**

Establishing a decentralized and secure way of giving every member of the community full control, without the risk of being controlled or abused by governments or corporations, is central to this proposal. LGBT Token will allow each member to not only define what is stored on the blockchain, but also to have full control of that information and who is allowed to access it. Only if their identity is fully protected against abuse will members be able to be aligned with their sexual and gender identities in an economic environment.

At the same time this identity can be verified and members protected against impersonation or other forms of identity theft.

#### Community Recognized Yet Individually Protected

Could our mission be accomplished with an traditional technology or currency? No<sup>token-2</sup>. We believe that the LGBT community and its membersâ€™ identities, as well as the rule of trade and the allocation of funds to further LGBT Impact causes, should be self-governed by the community and cannot be a derivative of a project with a different mission or uncertain prospect of survival. It cannot be guaranteed that any outside state or corporation, or a foundation with a different mission, would be as good a steward for the privacy of LGBTs as the members themselves.

By allowing for unique identification within the LGBT community, yet keeping that information secured with permissioned access, the trust required for the community to adopt LGBT Token is strengthened. Only the LGBT Token, based on blockchain technology, can deliver on this prerequisite to unlock the power of the Pink Economy.

### 2. LGBT Economy

As noted earlier, only a few companies in a few countries have fully understood that catering to the LGBT consumer can be of huge economic benefit. Many efforts have been clumsy and are difficult to deploy for smaller suppliers of goods and services, especially if they operate in less liberal countries. Only recently have companies started to develop products for the specific demand of the LGBT community, such as in financial services, hospitality and healthcare. It would be expected that the majority of corporate executives could provide a breakdown of their customer demographic by reference to age, provenance, or income, but anecdotal evidence confirms that it is unlikely they would be able to specify the percentage of their business that stems from the LGBT community.

` GRAPHIC OF A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE OR CLUB WITH A â€œLGBT TOKENS ACCEPTEDâ€ STICKER `

By participating in the Pink Economy outright, however, these companies can, in an easy and meaningful manner, directly reach the LGBT community to treat LGBT consumers with the right level of attention they welcome and deserve. The LGBT Foundation will use the publicly available blockchain data to visualize the growth and usage of the LGBT Token to educate businesses and countries to accelerate their interaction with and economic inclusion of the LGBT community. Once established, LGBT Token will then use its own internal data to help establish marketing and demographic patterns to even further define and understand the Pink Economy.

#### Endemic LGBT Economy

> **LGBT apps and services today already constitute an estimated USD 100M economy trading in virtual goods and services.**

Today, the Pink Economy is most visible in endemic businesses such as gay bars, LGBT cruises, or dedicated fashion stores, and digital businesses are confined to a handful of digital LGBT-centric apps and services.

LGBT-related digital business alone constitutes a USD 100M market trading in virtual goods, advertising, and services.<sup>token-3</sup> These activities can be transformed from fiat<sup>token-4</sup> to cryptocurrencies, and launch partners such as Hornet have pledged to accept LGBT Token both for payment and as rewards to the 25 Million members it is serving.



#### Making The Pink Economy Visible and Accessible

Just like society has allowed more and more LGBT members to safely come â€œout of the closetâ€, the Pink Economy is slowly following suit.  The LGBT Token will rapidly accelerate this process and unlock the untapped economic potential of optimizing the economic activity between any supplier and LGBT demand.

The economic optimization stems from the ability to better target and tailor products to members of the LGBT community.  By accepting LGBT Token as a method of payment in everyday transactions, businesses, large and small, can easily demonstrate their affiliation with the LGBT community. Furthermore they can optimize their LGBT-oriented business by being able to better target this important customer segment (which, depending on the industry, can constitute a large yet often elusive element of their corporate revenue) and understand their buying patterns and preferences.

On the flip side, they can reward and incentivize the desired behavior of LGBT community members, whether this is encouraging them to generate social media stories, or granting permission for marketing approaches.

With the adoption of the LGBT Token, todayâ€™s narrow, LGBT endemic digital USD 100M market can quickly grow as an identifiable and bespoke economy that transcends borders and respects each individual memberâ€™s right to both their sexual and/or gender identity and privacy.


#### Estimating Adoption of and Demand for LGBT Token

The adoption of LGBT Token will be spearheaded by fast-moving launch partners, such as Hornet, likely with endemic LGBT and digital businesses. Brick-and-mortar businesses, as well as non-endemic businesses, may adopt with a time lag, and be slower to convert a portion of their income into LGBT Token.

In the event that a secondary market develops, holders of LGBT Tokens may trade their Tokens if they are not able to directly recycle their Tokens into matching economic activity. Between the purchase and the sale of the LGBT Token, balances will be held in wallets before spending or after receiving such Tokens. Based on an average velocity of five churns per year, we believe it will take around three years to match the initial supply of Tokens with demand.

As proposed in the timeline below, we will release a much more in-depth look at the Token economics in our upcoming pink paper.


#### Make Token Usage Practical

Blockchain technologies have been around for a long time, yet most cryptocurrencies and tokens serve more as speculative assets than practical solutions to change people's lives. The LGBT Foundation strongly believe that these assets are only valid if they are usable.

To assist with creating a usable asset, the LGBT Foundation plans to streamline the process by moving existing spending and earning models from the launch partners, such as Hornet Network's premium subscription or its Perk Reward program to LGBT Token. A seamless integration will create a user-friendly experience and significantly lower the barrier of adoption that currently keeps other cryptocurrencies and tokens from being used in daily life.

#### Network Accelerator Program

The LGBT Foundation has established a Network Accelerator Program to help businesses adopt the Token. It proposes to set aside grants of Tokens, with 10% of the issued Tokens reserved to jumpstart launch partnerships and broad community adoption.

A portion of the Tokens will be set aside to be used by current and future LGBT Foundation members as they see fit to reward users that support their products and services. While the Tokens can be used to purchase services, for example, using the apps of the launch partners, the LGBT Foundation will also actively promote and enable other usage of Tokens. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Providing plugins for e-commerce stores to accept LGBT Token as payment
- Providing devices for locations to accept payments using LGBT Token

Hornet Networks brings to the LGBT Foundation trusted and longstanding relationships with numerous event locations in several major cities. In addition, the LGBT Foundation launch partners and advisors each bring well-established networks to the LGBT Foundation that will help help lay the foundations for the LGBT Token to become a regular form of payment.

The LGBT Token has a strong economic utility to each party engaging in an underlying transaction.  With the support of strong launch partners, the creation of Network Acceleration Program, and intuitive user and application programming interfaces, the LGBT Token will be rapidly adopted and utilized in everyday life.

### 3. LGBT Impact

LGBT Impact is a powerful funding mechanism for important causes of the LGBT community in their quest to achieve equal rights and acceptance.

> **LGBT Impact is the inherent and powerful funding mechanism for causes of importance for the LGBT community in their quest to achieve equal rights and acceptance.**

The LGBT Foundation proposes to have an annualized Token reserve specifically held for LGBT Impact.  Given the proposed regularity and size of LGBT Tokens reserved for LGBT Impact, we believe that it has the potential to be the largest dedicated LGBT social responsibility program in the world. We propose to include a fixed 1% annual inflation annualized Token creation to support the LGBT Impact program.

These LGBT Tokens can be directly allocated as financial assistance anywhere in the world or to support political activism, as well as to provide logistical and operational support.

LGBT Impact will seek input from the community in determining its projects. In the future, it is anticipated a vote among Token holders will determine the broad allocation of LGBT Impact Tokens to different causes and regions. Specific projects can be proposed by members with LGBT identity, and will be approved and administered by the LGBT Impact team through the LGBT Foundation. All grants and transactions are publicly visible in the blockchain, so that abuse can be reduced through utmost transparency, without putting the recipients or donors into danger by disclosing their actual identity.

Furthermore, in the future, subject to all regulatory approvals, it is envisioned that LGBT Impact will allow donations to be matched to specific projects or members with LGBT identity, injecting a further level of grassroots governance and direction into LGBT Impact's efforts. Also, LGBT Impact proposes to explore funding from major non-profit organizations to match its grants, or to pledge to burn Tokens in exchange for its community supervised efforts to help LGBT causes, large and small, anywhere around the globe. In both cases, the firepower of LGBT Impact can be amplified beyond its inherent funding power, while utilizing the community to allocate, supervise, and govern the funds.


#### Example LGBT Impact: Chechnya

` Chechen PICTURE `
> Fig: Chechen police have been engaged in systematic entrapment of gay men since 2017. The community, supported by Hornet, the market leader for gay apps in Russia, has been shedding light on this deprivation of rights and harm inflicted on LGBTs, and has helped to evacuate up to 70 men to safety, possibly saving their lives<sup>impact-1</sup> (Photo by Valya Egorshin/NurPhoto via Getty Images).

As an example, a recent wave of detention and torture of gay men in Chechnya<sup>impact-2</sup> beginning in February 2017 has become so outrageous that it has attracted the attention of and action by activists and financial supporters. As a market leader for gay apps in Russia, Hornet has been at the forefront of this effort, providing extensive coverage and education about the situation. But it also provided on the ground and behind-the-scenes work to evacuate up to 70 Chechen men to safety. Unfortunately it was a limited effort due to funding constraints, as it could have been extended to many more thousands of abused members of the LGBT community there.

Not all such acts of oppression draw similar levels of attention, but remain in the shadows. A response today could consist of media coverage, possible and likely partisan social media outrage, as well as grassroots initiatives supported by individual donations or occasionally larger grants. In the future, the LGBT Foundation envisions that any such incidents where the rights of LGBTs are oppressed should be identifiable - who are these victims, how many are there, and how can we reach them without endangering them? By doing so, the Foundation should be able to allocate and quickly transfer funds in order to make an immediate and meaningful difference on the ground.

> **The LGBT Foundation would aim to make sure that emergency Tokens are available immediately. This could literally save lives.**

It is consoling and supportive to put a sad face on articles reporting such prosecutions on social media since awareness is a key prerequisite for change. However, the LGBT Foundation believes that it is more effective to, for instance, transfer within hours USD 20,000 worth of Tokens directly and promptly to the victims, allowing them to organize transportation and security to reach safer pastures before getting injured or worse.

The LGBT Foundation would make sure that such emergency Tokens are:
-	available immediately,
-	that further Tokens can be mobilized quickly,
-	that these Tokens can be transferred across borders without hassle or undue cost,
-	and that they reach exactly the right targets without risks of compromising identities or unscrutinized embezzlement of such funds.

We imagine if that this entire process, from an initial call for help right up to purchasing plane tickets or travel fare to evacuate, could be achieved using LGBT Token, oneâ€™s sexual and gender identity and purchases would be protected and private throughout. It will, quite literally, save lives, but itâ€™s just one of the examples by which we could illustrate the numerous ways in which LGBT Impact can make a tangible difference in the lives of LGBT community members, no matter where they are.

## LAUNCH PARTNERS

Hornet Networks is the initiator and a founding member of the LGBT Foundation. We are currently in the process of selecting other launch partners from the LGBT community and beyond with an interest in implementing the LGBT Token in their business. Furthermore, we are building a roster of opinion leaders in the LGBT and cryptocurrency communities to advise the founders on this project and endorse its mission and the proposed implementation.

> **The Foundation invites everyone to support the project**

The Foundation invites everyone to support the project and specifically invites and financially supports launch partners who can help jumpstart the LGBT Token and the resulting economy. Such partners may be mobile apps, online services or traditional offline, brick-and-mortar businesses like stores or event locations, large brands or individual providers.  Everyone is invited as long as they support to the mission of equal rights and acceptance for the LGBT community and the proposed self-governance.

### Hornet - Gay Social Network

> _â€œAt Hornet, we pursue the mission to give the gay community a digital home.  We strive to foster meaningful connections between its members, to foster collaboration for the greater good, and to give advertisers a brand-safe access to the huge purchasing power of the communityâ€_ - Christof Wittig, Hornet Founder and CEO 

` SMALL HORNET LOGO `
Hornet has been a leading innovator in the gay community since 2011 and is the proud original sponsor of this proposal. It was born to create more meaningful ways to connect members of local gay communities, and has since evolved to a social lifestyle app by connecting people, listing events and locations, participating as a media outlet, giving advertisers access to the community, and actively supporting both local communities and global events.

Hornet is the number one gay app in a dozen countries, such as France, Brazil, Taiwan, and Russia, and rapidly growing in many other markets including the United States. Hornetâ€™s network boasts 25 million users, with over 4 million of them monthly active, generating over $10 million USD in revenue this year.

Hornet identifies as much as an advocate as a technology leader and is always looking for ways to use technology to empower and protect the members of the community. The engagements have included:
-	support for underprivileged communities like Casa Um, a shelter for LGBT youth in Sao Paulo<sup>launch-1</sup>, and
-	the Voguing community giving identity especially to people of color in Paris<sup>launch-2</sup>;
-	health protection with the Know Your Status (KYS) feature, an industry first<sup>launch-3</sup>;
-	educational videos about the effects of machismo on Latinos<sup>launch-4</sup> and
-	research with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health's efforts to better estimate the size of the LGBT community;
-	trips, local outreach, and international press to highlight situations in countries like Chechnya, Indonesia, or Egypt;
-	support for the gay Gotham Knights Rugby Football Club in New York City and
-	the successful first bid by Hong Kong for an Asian city to host the Gay Games in 2022, and many more.

As a result, Hornet is the only private company to be invited as Founding Member of the United Nations Global HIV Prevention Coalition<sup>launch-5</sup>, side by side with 30 nations and NGOs such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

With this background, Hornet found that the recent innovations in blockchain could offer huge benefits for the whole LGBT community. It funded the initiation of the LGBT Token project with substantial budgets and rallied partners and advisors to secure its successful launch.

` GRAPHIC: MORE LAUNCH PARTNERS TO BE ANNOUNCED SHORTLY `

## SETUP

One of the key ingredients to the success of the LGBT Token will be the accumulated experience of the launch partner Hornet, its team members, and the wide range of advisors and service providers recruited by the LGBT Foundation.

### Sponsorship by Hornet Networks

The LGBT Token initiative has been started and initially sponsored by Hornet Networks Ltd, a company based in Hong Kong. Hornet aims to lead the implementation especially in the early months of the LGBT Foundation and will serve as the first app adopting the LGBT Token. It is, however, the declared goal of Hornet to give the power of the LGBT Token to the community. Hornet is well aware that a project for the good of the LGBT community can only be initiated by an LGBT technology leader such as Hornet, a gay social network, but cannot be governed by it as it includes larger and larger parts of the community. To that end, the governance of the LGBT Token is entirely in the hands of the LGBT Foundation.

### The LGBT Foundation

The LGBT Token will be issued by the LGBT Foundation, an organization to initiate, develop and foster the ecosystem of the token. The LGBT Foundation will administer the supply and ensure a healthy economic model for the users and partners. It also intends to provide the necessary infrastructure to operate a decentralized and autonomous network. At the point of publishing of this paper, the LGBT Foundation shares certain resources with its sponsor, like overhead and development personel. The LGBT Foundation will, however, operate completely independent of Hornet and is building its own teams, governance and managment that will only operate in the interest of the missions stated in this paper.

### Usage Of The LGBT Token By The Launch Partners

#### Hornet Networks

Hornet helps its users to foster meaningful social connections.  It offers premium features and functions, such as â€œWho Checked You Outâ€, for users subscribing to a premium membership that is either purchased through an app store such as Apple iTunes or Google Play, Hornetâ€™s website, or by redeeming rewards (see below).

Hornet also sells advertising space in the app and on their website to premium advertisers through a direct salesforce, headquartered in New York City, or through advertising networks and exchanges all around the globe. Directly and indirectly, many major brands such as Verizon, GlaxoSmithKline, Iberia, Hilton, Uber, Apple are using Hornetâ€™s massive audience reach on a social mobile channel to attract the pink dollar.

Hornet pledges to implement a digital wallet based on the LGBT Token, instantly catapulting potentially millions of LGBT members into the cryptocurrency community and empowering them to play their economic hand in a secure yet meaningful way.

The digital wallet will allow users to view their balance based on blockchain and sidechain entries, review transactions, link to earning and spending opportunities with LGBT Tokens, and allow the transfer of LGBT Tokens for a small fee between its members.

Furthermore, Hornet pledges to migrate its existing Reward program for community contributions from current â€œPerksâ€ to LGBT Token.

` GRAPHIC: USAGE BY ADDITIONAL LAUNCH PARTNERS TO BE ANNOUNCED SHORTLY `

## LGBT TOKEN ISSUANCE AND TOKEN SALE

The LGBT Foundation will initially issue a total of 1,000,000,000 LGBT Tokens.

At the initial Token Sale, up to 20% or 200,000,000 Tokens will be distributed to the public in exchange for Ether contribution. Additional details about the initial Token Sale will be announced on the website [link]lgbt-token.org[/link].

The reserve is a special kind of smart contract that automatically mints a fixed number of LGBT tokens each week until the total reserve number of tokens has been minted. These minted tokens are to be used to improve the network (partner sponsorships, buying advertising, printing retail signage packs, increased development, etc.)

The allocation of reserve - and the beneficiaries of the LGBT Impact grants - are both managed using on-chain governance where each wallet has a number of votes in proportion to the number of tokens held and their reputation in the community. Reputation is derived from merchants and other users leaving reviews. Reviews weight in the user's reputation proportionately to the number of LGBT-Tokens that user has. The more trust you have, the more trust you confer when giving a rating to a merchant or another user of the platform.

<span style="color:red">**ALEX: I added some detail on the reserve - please confirm my understanding of this is correct - the idea is that we're minting the reserve until the cap is reached? that seems to be standard practice?**</span>

The proceeds of the initial Token Sales are proposed to be utilized to finance the development of the infrastructure described in this white paper.

Additional tokens will be distributed as follows.

` PIE CHART OF TOKEN DISTRIBUTION `

` THIS IS THE DATA FOR THE PIE CHART, PLEASE DON'T ADD THIS TO THE ACTUAL PAPER `

20% Token Sale
40% Reserve
15% Team
10% Integration Partners
10% Network Accelerator Program
5% Advisors

` INFO: The LGBT Foundation will not publish any Ether wallet address, nor will it publish any details on how to participate in the Token Sale publicly. The only way to participate in the sale and receive all required information on how to participate is by registering on https://lgbt-token.org for the Token Sale. We will publish all announcements and updates through our official channels: [link]Twitter[/link] and [link]Telegram[/link]. `

### Network Acceleration Program

To kickstart the ecosystem of the launch partners and future LGBT Foundation members, an amount of 10% of the initial Token supply or 100,000,000 tokens will be granted to the users of the participating partners. This will allow each app or community to immediately utilize the Tokens and to move existing reward programs seamlessly to the LGBT Token.

The Tokens will be carefully assigned to partners in the coming years as approved by the LGBT Token Advisory Board.

### Team Tokens

Team Tokens will be used used in two capacities. They are a compensation for the hard work of many people that made this initiative a reality, but they are also meant as an incentive for future contributors to the LGBT Foundation. All Team Tokens will be locked for at least 12 months and are vested over time while being bound to milestones and goals.

### Service Providers and Advisors

15% of the initial Token supply is reserved for current and future contributors of the LGBT Foundation, including service providers such as legal, marketing or technical experts, and a roster of advisors from a wide range of backgrounds. The Tokens will be generally in lock-up and are vested based on milestones such as reaching a certain adaption rate or bringing a certain number of partners on board.

### Token Reserve

All remaining, initially created Tokens will stay in a reserve to be allocated or offered at a later stage, depending of
the market situation and adoption rate. The reserve will be governed by the advisory board and will remain in lock-up for at least 12 months.

### LGBT Impact

The Foundation is planning to newly generate up to 1% annually of the entire Token stock to be deployed for the LGBT Impact program. The creation of such Tokens is contingent on the market cap and may be possibly expanded by third party sponsors pledging to burn Tokens in exchange for funds being delivered to recipients.

> **REQUEST FOR COMMENTS: We understand the importance of the Token economics for the crypto community. One of the challenges of this proposal is to strike a healthy balance between the needs of the crypto community and the LGBT community.**

### Proceeds Distribution

` PARAGRAPH UNDER REVIEW `

### Partners

The full list of partners will be released shortly. Please [link]subscribe to our newsletter[/link] to be informed about the launch partners and other parties that have expressed interest in adopting the LGBT Token.

## TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

The LGBT Tokens will be compliant with ERC20 standard and will be based on the Ethereum blockchain.  A technical white paper will also be considered in due course. This white paper focuses on the issues that the LGBT Foundation strives to solve. A paper with further details exploring the solution will be released separately.

At this stage, several elements of possible solutions are discussed as follows:

### Hybrid Off-Chain/On-Chain Architecture

Although the Ethereum blockchain technology is powerful due to its support for readily-deployable smart contracts, one of its oft-cited drawbacks is that it is expensive and slow to confirm a transaction. While there are a number of proposals on the roadmap to address the issue, it is presently not clear how the issue will be resolved in the near future. We are aware that the time taken to confirm a transaction on the blockchain is increasingly crucial as we move toward mass adoption, and are constantly surveying alternative solutions.

As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, the LGBT Foundation and each of its partners are evaluating a hybrid architecture (off-chain/on-chain solution) to support fast transaction execution required by an increasing volume of transactions, while preserving a sufficient degree of decentralization. Furthermore, we are constantly observing the advancements made by all major blockchain infrastructure providers to use the right technology for each one of our key purposes.

### Ethereum Settlement Layer

Users wishing to transfer LGBT Token into and out of the applications will be able to do so by interacting with the public Ethereum network, which will serve as a decentralized settlement layer. Initially, users interacting with the LGBT Token inside Hornet will have a more managed experience. This will allow the early version of the system to solve for blockchain scalability bottlenecks, feeless transactions, faster transaction times, and encapsulation of complex features like private keys. Over time, we expect the LGBT Token will be used beyond the launch partners, and we expect the development of blockchain technology to accommodate these features in a decentralized setting.

LGBT Foundation may be listed on public exchanges shortly after the initial Token Share and the LGBT Foundation will announce such developments accordingly.

## AN OPEN LETTER FOR PARTICIPATION

To whom it may concern,

On behalf of the newly formed LGBT Foundation, I would like to invite you to join us in our mission to empower the LGBT community by contributing to the planned LGBT Token project, designed to help advance equal rights and acceptance for the LGBT community around the globe.

The LGBT Foundationâ€™s Token Sale will take place in the first quarter of 2018, with the aim of using the power and potential of blockchain to raise funds and allocate cryptocurrency tokens to private investors and individual participants. A blockchain-based LGBT Token will establish a shared economic identity and infrastructure, which we can harness to not only empower and connect LGBT businesses around the world, but also help protect LGBT community membersâ€™ identities in a safe and secure environment.

Blockchain technology helps us reach this goal by allowing users to make transactions without anyone being able to trace the participants. Despite the anonymity, it remains inherently secure as the information is held on a network of computing devices, which collectively store and verify changes. This means blockchain can facilitate and authenticate payments and record the entire history of exchange, without either party needing to reveal their identityâ€“ a revolutionary step in the LGBT communityâ€™s fight for equal rights and acceptance.

As founder and CEO of Hornet Networks, Iâ€™ve seen firsthand the LGBT communityâ€™s economic might, and the potential it offers to help local communities, organizations, and individuals in their quest for equality and acceptance in society. Although we at Hornet have set up the LGBT Foundation, our aim is that it will evolve into a self-governing body run by and for members of the LGBT community to direct its activities, resources and members for the benefit of the international LGBT community.

In my professional career as a serial entrepreneur and investor, nothing has been more fulfilling than working every day on Hornetâ€™s mission to give the gay community a digital home that fosters meaningful connections and helps to drive acceptance.

The LGBT Foundation is a logical next step, much bigger than me or Hornet, or even my fellow gay men, but for the entire LGBT community. As a gay man, a tech entrepreneur with a strong open source background and a Stanford MBA, I feel obliged to call out the immense potential of blockchain, and the near perfect fit for our needs.

Today marks the start of a new phase in which we aim to secure that every LGBT person has the same opportunities and privileges as anyone else. In the future we will use resources from the LGBT Foundation to actively support members of the LGBT community in instances where they are vulnerable, distressed, or suffering from repression or inequality, from financial assistance to support political activism to logistical and operational support. And we will finally make the elusive economic power of the Pink Economy tangible and usable to further our rights and acceptance.

Thatâ€™s why I would like to call on the global LGBT community, its allies, and related interest groups to get involved with the LGBT Foundation.

Please visit [link]www.lgbt-token.org[/link] to learn more and join this major effort to make a meaningful difference for the LGBT community.

Yours Sincerely,
Christof Wittig
LGBT Foundation President
Hornet Networks Founder and CEO

# APPENDICES

## Appendix - The LGBT Foundation

The LGBT Foundation is a Hong Kong-based private company with the goal of supporting genuine equality and advancing the aims of the LGBT community across the world. By harnessing the power and potential of blockchain technology and other technological innovations, the LGBT Foundation aims to foster greater acceptance of the LGBT community, drive positive social change for the benefit of its members, and protect vulnerable community members. Its goal is to foster and realize the potential of the Pink Economy, and provide a safe and secure environment to access cryptocurrencies and other products and services, enabling members to verify and protect their identities as required.

Is is therefore envisioned as an ecosystem and technical infrastructure for all partners that accept and adopt LGBT Token. The LGBT Foundation is intended as an independent and democratic governance body for its members.

### Mandate

The primary goal is to partner with businesses to adopt and implement the LGBT Token and provide the necessary infrastructure to run the digital economy. The LGBT Foundation in the future may partner with other organizations if determined to be in the bests interests of the project.

### Safe, Secure, Compliant

Safety, security and compliance stand at the core of the LGBT Foundation and its ambition â€“ for the good of our community, our partners and the reputation of our LGBT Foundation. We provide a safe space for our members (LGBT Token holders) to interact with the outside world while being true to their identities.

From a compliance perspective, we are liaising with regulators across the world to ensure that we take the appropriate steps to be legally compliant at all times, and have retained a team of professional advisers to assist.

### Governance Goals

The LGBT Foundation will dedicate resources to establish a fair and transparent governance process that will take into account the voices and needs of all participants within the ecosystem. This open governance model will oversee decisions related to the membership process, the Token economy, participation rules, legal matters, and content and compliance guidelines.

<span style="color:red">**ALEX: We should discuss how the code itself is updated with respect to the foundation or token holders. See this from the GDAX Digital Asset Framework - the manual they use for whether to list a token on CoinBase / Gdax - we need to tick all these boxes to get listed by major exchangs: There is a structured process to propose and implement major updates to the code, or there is a system or voting process for conflict resolution.**</span>

### Research & Development Goals

Resources will foster an environment of innovation by working with partners to test new ways to participate in the ecosystem and drive value creation and network effects. The Foundation will also fund the development of tools that give LGBT Token partners the ability to build, grow, and create value for one another.

### Educational Goals

Identifying the size and power of the Pink Economy is one of the core aspects of the technology that the LGBT Foundation will establish. Anonymized data that protects the members as described above, but still allows the LGBT Foundation to report on the growth and flow of the Tokens to to educate businesses, organizations and countries about the size and positive impact the LGBT community has on their local economies.

### Supportive Goals For The LGBT Community

It is the declared goal of this paper to develop an implicit, transparent and simple mechanism for the LGBT Foundation to participate in the overall economy using the LGBT Token. As soon as a viable model is established, the Foundation will use its influx of Tokens to support local non-profit organizations, as well as outstanding individuals, influencers and advocates of the LGBT community.

Supporting the LGBT community clearly is an external task for the outside world as much as from within the community itself. As described in â€œInequality and the status of the LGBT communityâ€, the authors of this paper recognize the problems facing the community and want to establish a foundation that is alive to its social responsibility to address and ensure that inequality is reduced inside the community as well as outside.

### Voting Mechanism

The Advisory Board of the LGBT Foundation will regularly submit grant proposals that it believes deserves LGBT Impact support on the LGBT Foundation website. Each Token holder will be able to cast votes in support of the projects they believe should receive support. The number of votes is proposed to be equal to the number of Tokens a person holds.  The details of this voting mechanism will be announced in due course.

## Notes on the layout

  * The overall layout of the white paper is rather a brochure than a technical paper. We will release a more technical _yellow paper_ and a more traditional white paper layout later. Alternatively, we could call this one the Pink Paper :)
  * Please use a smaller font for the legal disclaimer, so it's not as prominent as the rest.
  * Embrace white space
  * Footnote int-1 used twice on purpose
  * Each H1 headline (UPCASE headlines) start a new page, ideally in a visually distinguishable fashion
  * Each blockquote is either a quote when in _italic_ or a pullquote when **bold**
  * All images need to list the source and may have a caption
  * The team pages (team, advisor, partner) should be in a grid format, please grab images from linkedin. We should include linkedin and twitter links where applicable
  * Please keep the "advisors to be announced" section in there and do not list the advisors as of now. The list of advisors is merely to collect the data
  * Footnotes are to be on the page where they have been referenced and are to be numbered only. We use per-paragraph named footnotes like _int-1_ for convenience. At the end, the footnotes should be numerical only.
  * Please add an element to the footer of the layout that links to the exact version of the white paper on github, ideally as Version number and hash. We will use tags accordingly: e.g. Version 0.5 (834a4fe) with `834a4fe` being a link to github (https://github.com/lgbt-foundation/white paper/commit/834a4fecfbe4369f478134ae15f1a540cfa274b2)
  * Please add a twitter and a telegram logo on the cover and the last page and link them to our official channels
