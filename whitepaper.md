# LGBT Token

## Disclaimer

This is an early version of the white paper where we aim to highlight a twofold problem: 1. the global “pink economy” of the LGBT community being neither properly utilized nor clearly defined and 2. nonprofit and charity funds not making it directly into the hands of the most marginalized and oppressed within the LGBT community, then work with the community to create real-world solutions. While this paper highlights key areas and technologies that we feel will provide a crucial foundation for those solutions, this is first and foremost an invitation of participation.

## INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the LGBT<sub>int-1</sub> community has reached an inflection point with an increased number of societies becoming more accepting of and providing equal rights to LGBTs.  The work of many organizations and individuals fighting for LGBT rights is one driving force behind this progress.  Another is that an increasing number of corporations worldwide are now openly supporting diversity and inclusion, understanding that it is fundamental to the operation of their business, and that it is an important matter to their customers.

Progress for the LGBT community has become visible through landmark events, such as:

  * The establishment of marriage equality in 26 countries as far apart as the U.S., Colombia, and South Africa, and soon with Taiwan and Austria to follow;
  * the emergence of openly LGBT politicians in the most senior leadership roles, such as Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, the Prime Minister of Iceland, in 2009 and Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, in 2017;
  * the apologies and rehabilitation issued to victims of anti-LGBT discrimination, such as Justin Trudeau’s $100M pledge to gay purge victims in Canada in 2017 or the Royal pardon of Alan Turing by the Queen of England in 2013;
  * the supportive stance of a large part of the international community of nations toward eliminating remaining anti-LGBT laws and constraining leaders in less progressive countries, most visibly in the United Nations Human Rights Council’s 2011 Resolution on LGBT Rights and General Assembly declaration of LGBT rights, signed by a combined 99 member states, and;
  * the improvements in treatment, cure, prevention, and increased de-stigmatization of HIV/AIDS, such as the FDA approval for Truvada as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 and Prince Harry’s continued call to de-stigmatize HIV in 2017.

But the hard work is far from over. There are still many countries in which openly identifying as LGBT results in massive repercussions or even life-threatening consequences. Even in countries where the legal basis appears equal, the reality is often different—discrimination, bullying and worse are experiences on which nearly every member of the community can give a firsthand report.


### Understanding The Challenges

While there are many complex factors that contribute to discrimination against the LGBT community, one initial but solvable challenge for the community is that both the size of the global community and the power of the worldwide pink economy are neither clearly defined nor understood. It is difficult it can be to quantify exactly the LGBT population, especially since those studies that do exist rely on respondents self-identifying as LGBT or voluntarily reporting their sexual orientation and behavior. Clearly, respondents’ willingness to do this can vary considerably by country, region and age group. It has also been observed that in anti-LGBT environments, members of the LGBT community may frequently be held back from full economic participation (i.e. joining in the labor force or gaining job promotions), which restrains their spending power.
Furthermore, the power of the pink economy has traditionally been clustered around the consumer interests of affluent, white gay men. The full spectrum of sexual orientations and and gender identities with the LGBT community has not, to date, been represented or recognized by corporations on anywhere near the same scale as that group. There is a pressing need for all in the LGBT community to be properly represented, and for their full economic participation to be realized.
As such, the untapped potential of the pink economy is not as forcefully utilized as it could be, if further developed, to help advance equal rights where it can and safeguard the community where it can’t.

### Estimating The Size Of The LGBT Community

Public polls and studies carried out by statistics agencies in advanced economies such as the U.S. and the UK have concurred that between 3 and 6 percent of the adult population identify as LGBT. A study carried out by Gallup<sup>int-2</sup> in the U.S. in 2017 found an average of 4.1% of U.S. adults (10 million in total) identified as LGBT, with over 7% of millennial-aged respondents identifying as LGBT. When applied on a global scale to the world’s adult population (16 years+) of 5.3 billion, the 3-7 percentage range gives an LGBT population estimate of between 160 million and 373 million adults globally. Putting that into perspective, if the LGBT community were a country, it would be the third-largest in the world by population, ranking behind only China and India.

### Understanding The Power Of The Pink Economy

The size of the LGBT community translates directly to major global economic impact. In terms of economic power, as a percentage of global GDP per capita, the LGBT community could be said to represent between $2 trillion and $4.2 trillion. Again, if we viewed the LGBT community, at the upper range, this would place the spending power of the pink economy on a level greater than the GDP of Germany. In other words, it would be the world’s 4th-largest economy.<sup>int-3</sup>

`INFOGRAPHIC SHOWING THE ECONOMIC POWER OF THE community IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTRIES`

The disposable income and earning power of the LGBT community continues to grow—at least part of the community. University of Washington’s Marieka Klawitter’s 2014 study determined that lesbians earn a premium of 9% more than heterosexual women. A recent study by Vanderbilt economists Christopher Carpenter and Samuel Eppink discovered that gay men who were employed full-time made on average 10% more than their straight male counterparts.

Only slowly are businesses realizing their loss if not acknowledging this spending power and properly addressing the needs and concerns of the community. More and more industries are just starting to understand that the community can make up significant portion of their income, e.g. up to 10% in the travel industry. The “pink dollar” often looks like any other dollar to them, which is a mistake.  Marketers routinely underestimate the strong loyalty of members of the community and how much it drives purchasing decisions due to a lack of data. While numerous studies have demonstrated that LGBT consumers show loyalty to specific brands that recognize and appeal to them directly, to date, economic activity has only been identifiable in specific sectors of the economy, such as fashion, entertainment, technology, travel, healthcare or financial services. In truth, a much greater pink economy exists and its scale and potential are yet to be fully revealed.

## Notes on the layout

  * The overall layout of the white paper is rather a brochure than a technical paper. We will release a more technical _yellow paper_ in a more traditional whitepaper layout later. Alternatively, we could call this one the Pink Paper :)
  * Embrace white space
  * Each H1 headline (UPCASE headlines) start a new page, ideally in a visually distinguishable fashion
  * Each blockquote is either a quote when in _italic_ or a pullquote when **bold**
  * All images need to list the source and may have a caption
  * The team pages (team, advisor, partner) should be in a grid format, please grab images from linkedin. We should include linkedin and twitter links where applicable
  * Footnotes are to be on the page where they have been referenced and are to be numbered only. We use per-paragraph named footnotes like _int-1_ for convenience. At the end, the footnots should be numerical only.
