## Disclaimer

This is an early version of the white paper where we aim to highlight a twofold problem: 1. the global “pink economy” of the LGBT community being neither properly utilized nor clearly defined and 2. nonprofit and charity funds not making it directly into the hands of the most marginalized and oppressed within the LGBT community, then work with the community to create real-world solutions. While this paper highlights key areas and technologies that we feel will provide a crucial foundation for those solutions, this is first and foremost an invitation of participation.

## INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the LGBT<sub>int-1</sub> community has reached an inflection point with an increased number of societies becoming more accepting of and providing equal rights to LGBTs.  The work of many organizations and individuals fighting for LGBT rights is one driving force behind this progress.  Another is that an increasing number of corporations worldwide are now openly supporting diversity and inclusion, understanding that it is fundamental to the operation of their business, and that it is an important matter to their customers.

Progress for the LGBT community has become visible through landmark events, such as:

  * The establishment of marriage equality in 26 countries as far apart as the U.S., Colombia, and South Africa, and soon with Taiwan and Austria to follow;
  * the emergence of openly LGBT politicians in the most senior leadership roles, such as Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, the Prime Minister of Iceland, in 2009 and Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, in 2017;
  * the apologies and rehabilitation issued to victims of anti-LGBT discrimination, such as Justin Trudeau’s $100M pledge to gay purge victims in Canada in 2017 or the Royal pardon of Alan Turing by the Queen of England in 2013;
  * the supportive stance of a large part of the international community of nations toward eliminating remaining anti-LGBT laws and constraining leaders in less progressive countries, most visibly in the United Nations Human Rights Council’s 2011 Resolution on LGBT Rights and General Assembly declaration of LGBT rights, signed by a combined 99 member states, and;
  * the improvements in treatment, cure, prevention, and increased de-stigmatization of HIV/AIDS, such as the FDA approval for Truvada as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 and Prince Harry’s continued call to de-stigmatize HIV in 2017.

But the hard work is far from over. There are still many countries in which openly identifying as LGBT results in massive repercussions or even life-threatening consequences. Even in countries where the legal basis appears equal, the reality is often different—discrimination, bullying and worse are experiences on which nearly every member of the community can give a firsthand report.

### Estimating The Size Of The LGBT Community

Public polls and studies carried out by statistics agencies in advanced economies such as the U.S. and the UK have concurred that between 3 and 6 percent of the adult population identify as LGBT. A study carried out by Gallup<sup>int-2</sup> in the U.S. in 2017 found an average of 4.1% of U.S. adults (10 million in total) identified as LGBT, with over 7% of millennial-aged respondents identifying as LGBT. When applied on a global scale to the world’s adult population (16 years+) of 5.3 billion, the 3-7 percentage range gives an LGBT population estimate of between 160 million and 373 million adults globally. Putting that into perspective, if the LGBT community were a country, it would be the third-largest in the world by population, ranking behind only China and India.
