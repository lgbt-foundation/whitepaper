## Abstract

A token to address the needs of the LGBT<sup>abst-1</sup> community is proposed. This token will aggregate the economic strength of the LGBT community, which is estimated to be between 3%-7% of the global household wealth<sup>abst-2</sup>. The token leverages this economic power and blockchain technology to advance equal rights and full acceptance for all members of the LGBT+ community worldwide. Both macro- and microeconomic models are proposed to facilitate a sustainable token economy that will encourage early network adoption through launch partners. The token technical design enables scalable transaction throughput, while protecting identity for members of the LGBT community. A route-to-market through launch partners is discussed on a high level and analysis undertaken to increase the likelihood that  a viable economy will emerge.

This Pink Paper is accompanied by the [White Paper](https://lgbt-token.org). The White Paper offers additional context and rationale on the opportunities and challenges concerning the LGBT community in general and the Pink Economy in particular. While not required, it it recommended to read both documents. For your convenience we reduced the context to a minimum in this document.

## LGBT Economy Strength

### The size of the LGBT economy

The estimated LGBT share of the global household wealth is $16 trillion ([LGBT Capital, 2016](http://www.lgbt-capital.com/docs/Estimated_LGBT-Wealth_(table)_-_May_2016.pdf)) which constitutes a significant portion (6%) of the estimated global household wealth of $250 trillion ([Credit Suisse Research Institute: Global Wealth Report 2015](https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=F2425415-DCA7-80B8-EAD989AF9341D47E)). The estimated global purchasing power of the LGBT economy in 2016 was between $2 trillion and $4.6 trillion (Peter Jordan (LGBT Consumer Trends), 2018). This represents a significant portion (4.7%) of the estimated global purchasing power of $115.6 trillion ([World Bank, 2015](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD?end=2016&start=1990&view=chart&year_high_desc=false)).

The geographical breakdown of this spending power is roughly proportional to the standard breakdown of total purchasing power, with Asian spending dominating all other markets (more than both the US and European Union combined). This is particularly relevant considering the size of Asian cryptocurrency markets and penetration of cryptocurrency technologies. In mid-2017, Asia was estimated to constitute 38% of all cryptocurrency users ([Cambridge, 2017, p.109](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf)). However, it is difficult to ascertain how many of these users are speculative in nature.

Western economies offer a combination of technological progress and LGBT freedoms, offering the biggest potential for adopting products that intersect these markets. The North American and European Union LGBT markets, both worth about $1 trillion (LGBT GDP, WEALTH & TRAVEL 2016 by LGBT Capital, 2016<sup>econ-1</sup>), are of particular note.

### LGBT spending habits

There are strong indicators<sup>spen-1</sup> that LGBT people are more likely to spend at inclusive businesses. Survey data, as will be discussed below, indicates that many make an intentional effort to do so. The following statements are from markets (mainly the US) where no direct repercussions for being a member of the LGBT community are expected. The reality differs vastly in other regions.

The LGBT community has diverse spending habits due to its wide variety of subgroups. For example, the [average household income of gay men differs from that of lesbians significantly](http://www.experian.com/blogs/marketing-forward/2012/07/20/sim-a-look-at-household-income-and-discretionary-spend-of-lesbian-gay-and-heterosexual-americans/). However, both married male-male couples and female-female couples have, on average, [higher household income than their heterosexual counterparts](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/WP-108.pdf) in regions where equal rights have been obtained. 59% of gay and bisexual men reported visiting an LGBT nightclub in the past 12 months and 42% of lesbian and bisexual women did. Across the board, there is a consistent ratio of LGBT people (i.e. 45% in the USA) donating to LGBT organizations<sup>spen-2</sup>. While donating forms a large part of the LGBT community, these statistics have remained stable over the past five years.

The LGBT community perceives itself to be financially stable, with only 15% reporting a negative economic outlook for themselves. Both tourism and cultural events form a significant part of LGBT spending<sup>spen-4</sup>, with over two-thirds of LGBT people reported spending  over $50 eating out weekly. Thes are significant markets that could further optimize their appeal to the LGBT community.

The LGBT community overwhelmingly favours using the services of businesses that support the community. 88% of respondents in the CMI survey reported that corporations that support LGBT equality are essential and 77% reported that companies that support LGBT equality would get more of their business in the next year. The reverse also seems to be true, such as when [LGBT people actively boycotted Chick-fil-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A_same-sex_marriage_controversy) after it was perceived to be anti-LGBT.

11% of LGBT people reported being self-employed. This is a significant portion of the LGBT market that immediately has a natural interest in engaging commercially with the LGBT community. The National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. certifies LGBT-owned businesses, but has only [909 certified businesses](http://nglcc.org/sites/default/files/[REPORT]%20NGLCC%20Americas%20LGBT%20Economy%20.pdf). When considering that only 7% of respondents in the CMI survey indicated that they are a registered LGBT Business Enterprise, this gives an encouraging approximation for the total amount of LGBT-owned businesses (around 13,000 in the USA).

When it comes to online dating, 44% of gay and bisexual men reported using a dating app that specifically caters to gay men. 

From the above, we can see that that the LGBT community is diverse in its spending and rewards LGBT-friendly businesses. Though many businesses are LGBT friendly, they may not have had an easy way to indicate this to potential customers. Providing them with a convenient way to do this, without significant investment or marketing, would likely be valuable to both the LGBT community and to supportive businesses.


## LGBT Challenges

The LGBT community currently faces economic, social and legal challenges. While Western societies have made progress on recognizing the rights of people with differing sexual orientations – through enacting legislation and corporate social responsibility – this has not always extended to the larger worldwide LGBT community. 


### Criminal Persecution

LGBT people require privacy due to the wide scope of discrimination experienced in many countries<sup>chal-1</sup>. There are many complex factors that contribute to this discrimination, from religious fundamentalism to more nuanced social issues like transgender bathroom laws. Due to sodomy laws, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in a number of countries.


### Societal Persecution

Although good progress has been made, there are still significant risks of persecution for members of the LGBT community. Even in developed countries like the U.S., members of the community are still socially excluded and heavily discriminated against. For example, in a [breakout report from the National Center for Transgender Equality’s U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS)](https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Black-Respondents-Report.pdf), which aggregated data from 27,715 respondents nationwide, 796 African-American transgender or gender non-identifying respondents clarified the stark reality facing them:

 * 20% of respondents were unemployed, twice the rate of African-American people in the U.S. population, and four times that of the U.S. population overall.
 * 42% had been homeless at some point in their lives, compared to 30% of the USTS sample overall.
 * 38% were living in poverty, compared to 24% of black people in the U.S. population.
 * 53% have been sexually assaulted at one point in their lives, compared to 47% of all USTS respondents.
 * 6.7% were HIV+, nearly five times the rate of the USTS sample and 20 times the U.S. population.

LGBT charities require funding for programs to overcome this societal stigma and advance equal rights. Even in countries like the U.S., these charities don’t receive enough funding to handle the number of people that need their services, and face many hurdles with moving funds around the world to where the projects are based. LGBT charities often require emergency funds to increase the level of activity in response to acts of persecution. Donating money across borders using fiat currency is often an expensive and slow process, in addition to legal hurdles faced by some LGBT organizations accessing their funds in less accommodating countries. There is clearly the desire to donate and there is clearly a need globally to support LGBT and equal right programs.


## Opportunities for Cryptocurrency

### LGBT-friendly Business Prospects
The Human Rights Commission (HRC) gave 609 large businesses a perfect score in its Corporate Equality Index 2018. In the U.S., many businesses prior to the landmark Supreme Court ruling legalising same-sex marriage extended spousal benefits to same-sex employees. Additionally, some businesses cover medical expenses for trans employees. While this is indicative of increasing levels of support for the LGBT community, consumers may not be aware of this. 

Although many businesses are LGBT friendly, they may not realize that explicit support for the LGBT community would be economically beneficial to them, or have no idea how to express such support. If a standard means by which this could be indicated was introduced, it would go a long way to broadening the reach and impact of the Pink Dollar<sup>oppo-1</sup>.

Tokenizing the Opportunities

 * Creating a cryptocurrency dedicated to the LGBT community will provide a convenient opportunity for businesses to express their support for the LGBT community. While doing so, they will be able to attract more customers, due to the loyalty these customers tend to exhibit to LGBT-friendly businesses.
 * Using a cryptocurrency running on an appropriately decentralized blockchain network will provide members of the LGBT community with a level of pseudonymity not available to them in traditional payment methods (such as credit cards). This will give LGBT community members in less friendly countries access to products and services that they would not previously have had access to.
 * Having a cryptocurrency dedicated to the LGBT community will mobilize the masses of this community into a tangible, global economic network. Through the presence of the cryptocurrency, the community can raise awareness and measure its impact on businesses, charities and boycotts. The high affinity of LGBT people to sympathetic causes, even if these projects are less ‘user-friendly’ will allow this cryptocurrency to bridge the gap between the current technical cryptocurrency community and mainstream adoption.
 * Using a cryptocurrency, LGBT community members can easily fund charities anywhere in the world for LGBT-related causes. The cryptocurrency will bypass traditional transaction processing bureaucracy and costs, with the savings effectively being passed onto those who need the funds most. Also, a cryptocurrency can prevent funds from easily being seized by governments. The cryptocurrency also provides the opportunity for funds generated in the network from standard activities (such as payment transactions) to be directed to charities.


## Introducing the LGBT Token

_The LGBT Foundation aims to deliver equal rights and full acceptance for all members of the LGBT community worldwide. The LGBT Foundation enables the LGBT community to exert its considerable economic might, provides a safe and secure environment to access cryptocurrencies and other products and services, and enables members to verify and protect their identities. The Foundation will allocate resources on an ongoing basis to support and defend LGBT community members from oppression, discrimination and inequality._


### Token Objectives

The high-level LGBT Token objectives are:

1. enable members to assert and protect their LGBT identity;
2. demonstrate and exert the economic might of the LGBT community by creating a new medium of exchange for its use; 
3. make a global social impact by allocating resources to projects that the LGBT community cares about, including tackling oppression, discrimination and inequality, education and healthcare.

The first token objective is not strictly speaking linked to the token economy, but rather a necessity to safely engage in the token economy. The technical design of the system will link an identity, stored in a decentralized manner, to a Single Sign-On (SSO) and cryptocurrency wallet. This system is intended to be a self-sovereign identity i.e. users are encouraged, but not forced to self-declare information. This information may be as simple as a name, or more private, such as sexual preference or HIV status. Once they have declared their identity, users can re-use this ID with other network partners who use the SSO system. The system may use Civic or U-Port as the basic sign-on software, with additional optional fields. The exact technical design of this solution is still being explored.

The second and third token objectives can be rewritten and expanded upon, so that they can be applied to the token economy. The restated token objectives would then be:

2. incentivize members of the LGBT community to unite around using the LGBT Token as a medium of exchange for all purchases;
3. use the LGBT Token to fund LGBT-centric causes.

These two objectives tie into each other, as the bigger the adoption of the token, the more money can be spent on charitable causes. Thus, the focus on the token economy design will be maximising objective two. 

## Token Economics

One of the primary aims of most decentralized networks is to reduce the volatility of the native token’s price in terms of more stable currencies (such as bitcoin or fiat). There is still much debate regarding how best to value cryptoassets, but the prevailing approach is to use a form of the traditional macroeconomic [Quantity Theory of Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money) applied to cryptoeconomics. This model is expressed in the [Equation of Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange):

![M \cdot V = P \cdot Q](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?M%20%5Ccdot%20V%20%3D%20P%20%5Ccdot%20Q)
	
  * ![M](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20M) is the monetary supply, the total number of tokens in the network.
  * ![V](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20V) is the token velocity, the number of times a single token is transferred within a fixed period.
  * ![P](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20P) is the price of one ‘unit’ of output in terms of the native token.
  * ![Q](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20Q) is the total output in the given time period. The output here could be ‘total volume of transactions’ in a cryptoeconomy. Note that this is the total volume of transactions **in terms of the native token**.


The goal is to determine the value of ![E](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20E), the exchange rate of a single token for a more stable and established currency (say USD). We can apply the following transformation:

![E \cdot M \cdot V=\alpha \cdot Q](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E%20%5Ccdot%20M%20%5Ccdot%20V%3D%5Calpha%20%5Ccdot%20Q)

where is ![α](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Calpha) the price of one ‘unit’ of output in terms of the currency used in the exchange rate ![E](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20E) (say USD).

Making ![E](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20E) the subject of the equation,

![E = \frac{\alpha \cdot Q}{M \cdot V}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha%20%5Ccdot%20Q%7D%7BM%20%5Ccdot%20V%7D)

shows us that in this model the price of the token in USD depends on many factors. The monetary supply is typically fixed or growing at a known rate. The quantity of output is hard to control and is determined by the utility offered and the number of participants in the network.

Based on the above equation, there is an inverse relationship between velocity and token value (in terms of USD) - higher velocity results in a lower token price and lower velocity results in a higher token price. 

In the token economic design here, we primarily focus on ways to manage the token velocity to produce a sustainable token price, so that the new cryptocurrency is useful as a medium of exchange. It is worth noting that token velocity control levers are proposed mechanisms and there is no unanimous agreement among traditional economists or cryptoeconomists on the optimal way to control or accurately measure velocity.


### Token Use Cases

To be able to implement velocity-control mechanisms in the LGBT Token network, it is necessary to consider the major use cases of the token. These use cases will comprise the majority of transactions in the system and therefore dictate the rate at which tokens flow through it. Identifying key use cases and implementing them in the network with (adjustable) velocity considerations in mind will allow the network to modulate velocity and, by extension and to some extent, token price. The following primary use cases have been identified:

Transactional use cases:

* **Standard cryptocurrency, anonymous use case:** Users will transact with businesses who accept LGBT Tokens as payment.
* **Standard cryptocurrency, identity use case:** Users can purchase goods and services tied to their identity (with their permission and anonymized on the public ledger) e.g. purchasing tickets for an LGBT-related festival.
* **Impact program:** Users donate LGBT Tokens to various charities through the LGBT Impact Program, which forms part of the LGBT Token network infrastructure.

Incentivization use cases:

* **Rewards:** Launch partners distribute tokens to members of their networks for good behavior and for generating content.
* **Micro-payments:** Micro-interactions between users on social networks which use the LGBT Token for points or as an in-app currency. This may involve tipping or spending additional tokens to do ‘special’ actions on the network with other users.
* **Market research:** The Foundation will conduct market research by allowing users to share their data via a paid opt-in process. Eventually, this will allow the LGBT Foundation to produce research reports about the Pink Economy by using the data they have gathered.

Voting use cases:

* **Voting and decentralized governance:** The long-term vision of the LGBT Token involves the LGBT Foundation divesting its powers and responsibilities to a decentralized body governed by token-holders on the network. Currently, there is no industry consensus on the best decentralized governance model. The Foundation is investigating appropriate mechanisms that will allow token holders to participate in token governance in a sustainable and legally appropriate manner. The governance decentralization process will explore how to implement token holder participation through three key governance functions, namely: nomination, election and recall.

Transactional use cases constitute interactions which mirror their traditional counterparts in their implementation, albeit with the added benefit of convenience and low transaction costs, to incentivize usage.

Incentivization use cases are different, as they involve the token being earned for certain types of behavior. They are predicated on an out-of-network actor, such as a launch partner, incentivizing users to behave in a particular way. We aim to harness these use cases to modulate token velocity. This will be done by assisting and incentivizing network partners to incorporate microeconomic models, which link the token value to the transaction value within the network. This is discussed in the token micro-design section below.


## Token Macro-design

We provide an overview of the proposed macroeconomic variable values in the LGBT Token network. Due to unknown implementation details of certain aspects of the network (such as governance), some of these variables are discussed at a higher level, whereas others are explored at a more granular level.


### Inflation

Network inflation can be used as a reward (i.e. incentivization) mechanism to encourage particular actors to behave correctly. Inflation, coupled with transaction fees, are the two primary mechanisms for creating financial incentives in a cryptocurrency network.

There are a variety of possible inflation mechanisms – with respect to both existing circulating supply at the time of inflation and the total supply:

1. Issue a fixed amount without inflation. Rewards and incentives would have to be generated without inflation. This model is deflationary in nature due to limited supply and the inevitability of lost tokens. 
2. Generate tokens indefinitely at either a fixed or variable rate. Ethereum presently has a varying inflationary model. The alternative is to issue at an effective fixed rate of total supply annually. This would have a compound effect on circulating supply over multiple years and considerations would need to be made on the effect on price based on the rate of supply.
3. Generate tokens only for a certain period of time. This is what Bitcoin does: a decelerating inflationary model that converges to zero. The total supply converges to some fixed value. 

As aforementioned, inflation must be carefully considered based on what it is expected to enable on the network. While inflation has been shown in models to have a positive effect in token economies, these models reach this conclusion from the premise of incentivized inflation. Based on the above information, the inflation of the LGBT Token will be managed as follows:

1. Newly generated tokens are directed to the LGBT Impact fund, to address the program, operating costs and other activities that serve to benefit the ecosystem. The voting mechanism of the LGBT Impact program is described in the token micro-design section.
2. Transaction fees in the system can be used for multiple purposes. Some of these purposes include:
   * as rebates to cover exchange fees in the system for merchants.
   * discounts for users to incentive the token use.
   * funding the LGBT Foundation.
   * being directed into a special project fund that is controlled by a decentralized governance mechanism. 

Both the [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm) and the [European Central Bank](http://www.ecb.europa.eu/explainers/tell-me-more/html/stableprices.en.html) state that the ideal inflation rate is 2%. However, due to the expected annual growth of the LGBT Token, the initial token economy is more akin to that of a high-growth emerging economy. The [median inflation target for developing countries is 3%](https://voxeu.org/debates/commentaries/inflation-targeting-developing-countries-revisited), however, for the past few years, the average BRICS inflation rate has been [somewhere between 3% and 6%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/741754/inflation-rate-in-the-bric-countries/).

Before trying to use traditional macroeconomic figures as a guide for a reasonable inflation mechanism, it is important to note that cryptoeconomies are significantly different in nature. Inflation targets set by central banks are calculated using macroeconomic variables that don’t exist in cryptoeconomies.

The inflation mechanism proposed is subject to change as the economy is developed further. Launch partners will be allocated tokens that are released at fixed time intervals, which also simulates inflation in the medium term<sup>infl-1</sup>. There will be no inflation mechanism through new token creation in the short and medium term. In the longer term, an inflation mechanism of up to 1% may be introduced depending on the state of the network and its economy.


### Token Distribution

Analysis has shown a wide variety of token allocations for successful ICOs in 2017<sup>toke-1</sup>. The distribution needs to satisfy the ecosystem itself and all stakeholders involved. We can identify the stakeholders in the early LGBT Token network as:

* Public users who hold and utilize LGBT Tokens
* Launch Partners of the network
* Team members who contribute to the development of the network
* The LGBT Foundation

Each of these stakeholders need to be allocated an amount of the initial total supply to satisfy the objectives of the token economy. For allocations that result in a more centralized holding of tokens, rules must be introduced stipulating when these tokens are accessible, to provide long-term commitment and ensure market manipulation is infeasible. 

The token allocations which will be used for the LGBT Token are:

* A token allocation of 18.6% to the team and advisors. This ensures the development team attracts high-quality talent with a commitment to the success of the project. These tokens will be vested over a period of four years with a fractional release at fixed time intervals (such as every 12 months) to ensure market manipulation cannot happen. 
* 5% toward the LGBT Impact Program. This will be used as an initial supply for the Impact Program until sufficient network activity generates funds for charities.
* 30% toward the token sale. The proceeds of the token sale will be used to cover expenses to build the LGBT Token network and bring it to market.
* 33% toward the network accelerator program (NAP) to incentivize Launch Partners to use the token on their platforms. Usage of these tokens is described more fully in the Partner Program document, to ensure that the partner tokens create more network value than what they dilute. This is the portion of the total token supply that seeks to ensure that the token will have significant utility in the early phases of the network. 
* 1.4% toward token sale-related costs such as the sale itself, as well as preparatory and advisory costs incurred by the LGBT foundation and other participating organisations.
* 12% as a reserve held by the LGBT Foundation. This is to be used at the Foundation’s discretion and may go toward initial operating costs or distributed to other stakeholders as necessary. This reserve will be locked up for at least 12 months.

`` [[ TOKEN DISTRIBUTION PIE CHART ]] ``


### Number of Tokens

The determination of the number of tokens in a cryptoeconomy is more psychological than quantitative. Most platforms accommodate denominations of up to 18 decimal places<sup>toke-2</sup> which means the number of tokens won’t influence the ability to conduct transfers in the system. Psychological aspects of denominations can influence the perception of the utility of a single denomination<sup>toke-3</sup>:

1. Denominations that relate to commonly found denominations in fiat currencies promote recognition and association with tangible value. For example, $0.01 is a tangible amount of value that any person from the U.S. can relate to, whereas $0.001 is an abstract concept.
2. Given a significant token price, people may consider an individual token expensive due to its price without regarding its purchasing power. In the absence of any other information, people will assume the standard price for a service on the network will cost an integral, as opposed to fractional, amount of LGBT Tokens. They may mistakenly believe that a high-priced token represents low purchasing power.

It is relevant to note the expected use cases of the system and what this entails for the minimum and maximum USD sizes of transactions in the system:

1. Both physical payments and online payments to retailers can range on the order of cents to thousands of USD.
2. Similarly, donations will vary over a wide range of USD values.
3. Tickets for events and entertainment can range from  $10 to $1000.
4. The value of a tokenized reward in a system is harder to determine. Typically, content creation can reward very small ($0.01) to very large amounts<sup>toke-4</sup>, depending on the number of views generated. Users should be able to send very small denominations for the purposes of tipping, social interaction and other non-payment oriented activities. This can be handled semantically by either assigning a formal name to denominations smaller than a token size<sup>toke-5</sup>, or handled by having a very low token value with a very large supply.

Given all of the above, of primary note is the consideration that the starting token value should be larger than $0.01 (1 US cent). Given that this is expected to be a medium of exchange token with a wide distribution of tokens across many wallets and social apps, it is prudent to have a very large token supply. A recommended total token supply of 1 billion would mean that 300 million tokens are provided in the sale. The token price at issue should then be in the order of $0.32<sup>toke-6</sup>.


### Volatility

Most cryptocurrencies suffer from a volatility problem. Due to the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies as cryptoassets, a large portion of volume traded daily for most coins is between speculative buyers and sellers on exchanges which directly influences their price.  Such markets suffer from an extreme form of reflexivity. Currently, for most networks, at least at the present time, very few tokens are used for utility. Even among coins that have a working product<sup>vola-1</sup>, the price is still vulnerable to general cryptocurrency market movements and this behavior will always occur to some extent while the majority of the cryptocurrency market capitalization is speculative<sup>vola-2</sup>.

LGBT Token is intending to release a working product while the market is still in this state<sup>vola-3</sup>; volatility will almost certainly occur in the token price. Due to the fact that the initial utility of these tokens comes from Launch Partners, who likely reward users actions with fiat-denominated rewards, the distribution of these tokens will be inconsistent. For example, assume the value of an LGBT Token at the beginning of a fixed time interval is ![2X](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%202X) and over this time interval the value of the token varies between ![X](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20X) and ![3X](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%203X). The reward mechanism would have to adjust distributions based on these prices at any given time. This has multiple detrimental and uncontrollable effects:

1. A situation arises where over a short period of time the number of tokens various users receive for the same action is markedly different. 
2. If the token price rises significantly (say from ![X](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20X) to ![3X](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%203X)) once rewards have been distributed, these may all be used to claim tangible rewards from Launch Partners which could represent an unexpected loss to the Launch Partner, who would assume the exchange risk.
3. There are speculative consequences to price volatility too<sup>vola-4</sup>. Many users may be discouraged from holding or staking under conditions of volatility.

There have been a few mechanisms attempted to address this speculative volatility. The most prominent is that of the stablecoin, which is a cryptocurrency that has price stability as a primary function. 

We do not recommend implementing mechanisms that would make the LGBT Token a stablecoin. We believe the largest uncertainty regarding the coin’s price will be during the initial years where there will be large growth and speculation. Therefore, temporary measures to address the symptoms of volatility are the most practical approach. The proposed solutions refer to launch partners which operate some form of reward system in their networks.

Assuming a launch partner is willing to commit to between 0% and ![X](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20X)% of the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer in rewards, then the reward payouts in tokens could be adjusted less frequently to reduce volatility in its network (which is the primary driver of initial utility). Therefore, the launch partner would incur some costs (up to some threshold level based on ![X](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20X)) to ensure it does not have to continually adjust reward payouts and create a volatile reward system. Consequently, all users in the given time interval will be awarded a fixed number of tokens for an activity, regardless of LGBT Token price fluctuations during that interval.

An alternative (or additional) approach is for a launch partner to declare that on any given day (or fixed time interval), a fixed number of tokens decided at the beginning of the time interval, based on the token price, are available as rewards in the system. No matter how many users participate in the system<sup>vola-5</sup>, the specified rewards are handed out based on incentivized behavior<sup>vola-6</sup>. This is open to collusion for some types of activities, but with an appropriate identity management system, these problems should be mitigated.

The Foundation will consult with each individual launch partner to ensure that mechanisms are used that limit volatility impacting their user experience, while not curbing economic activity and suppressing price signalling.


### Price-stability and Velocity Considerations

There are various mechanisms that can be implemented to reduce price volatility of the LGBT Token. One of the primary ways to confer value to a token is to ensure token velocity is acceptably low, as discussed above. Here is an overview of all price-stability levers which were explored and their feasibility for the LGBT Token use cases.


| Lever                 | Description | Viability for LGBT Token |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Dividends             | Continuous income through the holding of tokens from protocol design such as transaction fees or inflation. Lowers velocity. | Unfeasible for the LGBT Token. Both transaction fees and inflation are designated for other use cases. |
| Staking               | Tokens are locked up for a certain amount of time in order to perform a lucrative function. Lowers velocity. | Staking can be used in reward programs by launch partners, but likely not on a protocol level. |
| Gamification          | Incentivize holding of tokens in exchange for larger rewards or discovery. Lowers velocity. | Feasible if a large number of launch partners will use the token for rewards. The appendix contains a  microeconomy template for launch partners incorporating a gamification model. |
| Curation Markets      | A market with a native token where users curate particular subtopics. Buy-in is through a predefined token price curve. Lowers velocity. | Unfeasible for the LGBT Token. No reason to use LGBT Token as a reserve token over more established tokens. |
| Cryptocurrency        | Becoming a cryptocurrency with mass adoption encourages holding for convenience and as a store of value. Lowers velocity. This is a long-term goal. | Difficult to ensure but providing a wide variety of launch partners during the early stage will be a primary driver. The token requires time to become a true cryptocurrency. This is a long-term goal.
| Money Supply Changes  | Maintaining price stability through adjusting the money supply through inflation and burning mechanisms. | This approach is considered infeasible due to its centralized nature and legal ramifications. |
| Discount Token Models | Applying a Discount Token Model where holding tokens enables a discount for transactions. Lowers velocity. | Possible to use for LGBT Token depending on services offered. Can be used in a microeconomic template for launch partners in tandem with gamification. |
| Airdrops              | Token airdrops to holders of other currencies in order to encourage use would increase velocity if these holders spend the token. | Airdrops for arbitrary Ethereum (or any other cryptocurrency holders) holders is deemed infeasible as it provides no utility and introduces reputational as well as potential regulatory risk. |
| Promotional Events    | Offering tokens to targeted demographics in concentrated LGBT centers will promote the use of the token to appropriate demographics, increasing velocity. | This is appropriate for the LGBT Token as it addresses the target market and introduces potential users to the network. These users derive maximum utility from the LGBT Token. |


## Token Micro-design

### Microeconomic Model

A microeconomic template has been developed for launch partners (which operate a network-based app) to implement using the LGBT Token to incentivize appropriate behaviors by all actors in the network<sup>micr-1</sup>. Below, this template is applied to the Hornet use case, which will be the first partner in the LGBT Token network.


### Example: Hornet Network

[Hornet](https://hornet.com) currently has a reward program which rewards users points for certain activities, which can be redeemed in the Hornet store. This will be transferred to the LGBT Token and expanded to increase functionality and utility of the program. We will apply a microeconomic model to the Hornet Reward Program context to see how it can be used by any launch partners with a network-based app.


### Hornet Overview

Hornet is a social networking app for gay men which intends to give them a more meaningful and holistic way to express themselves and connect with others. It has a mobile app and web-based app, which allows users to upload information, message others and upload “stories” which are similar to posts on other social networking sites. This is intended to be expanded to include much more engagement functionality by users in line with Hornet’s vision of becoming a social media platform where gay men can be their true selves. Additionally, there are features to find local clubs and other LGBT-related events and businesses. 

When Hornet switches to the LGBT Token, it will have an associated wallet to store a users’ LGBT Tokens. Additionally, there will be a decentralized SSO layer which will be used to manage user identity. This will increase privacy when transacting.

We can see below how the Hornet app translates directly to the generalized template found in the appendix. The motivations for each actor are as described above.


### Token Route to Market

The Route-to-Market is designed so that the token can demonstrate and exert the economic strength of the LGBT community.

In order to achieve this, we break down how to unite the LGBT community around the token. We believe that there are three types of participants in the token economy. These are:

1. Token Partners: the businesses who are willing to accept and use the LGBT Token, such as LGBT specific digital services (like Hornet and Revry) and brick-and-mortar businesses (like Out of Office and Oasis)
2. Token Backers: HNI (High Net Worth Individuals) and funds who are have invested in the token sale or brought the token on the open market.
3. Token Users: Members of the LGBT community, who will use the token as a transactional medium.


We believe – on a high-level – the route-to-market process is as follows:

1. Seed Partners with the token. These partners must use the token as a reward or incentive for their users. This will allow:
  * Users to understand the value of the token as they would have earned it through performing work e.g. for Hornet this would be platform-enhancing behavior.
  * Partners to work out a sustainable reward strategy. These partners should not gift the tokens in an unsustainable way as, eventually, they will be required to purchase rewards tokens off of an external cryptocurrency exchange at market prices. Thus, the rewards to users must be lower than their lifetime value (LTV) as customers,.
  * The number of token holders to increase, which in turn will increase the  utility of the token.
2. Promote earning by Users: This process will be initiated by Partners. As described above, Partners will encourage Users to earn LGBT Tokens for completing specific high-value behavior.
3. Promote spending by Users: Initially partners, but eventually brick-and-mortar stores will be encouraged to accept the LGBT cryptocurrency tokens as payment. As discussed in token opportunities, these stores will accept the token as it signals their progressive nature and LGBT community support. Furthermore, stores can be incentivized by offering ‘cash-back’ compared to traditional payment methods e.g. A user receives a 1% rebate.
4. Eventually, once the token is accepted by a significant portion of the LGBT community, it will become a sustainable MoE and Unit of Account (UoA).


### Launch Partner  Microeconomic Model

We explored the LGBT Token implementation in Hornet, the gay social media app, who is also a key launch partner of the LGBT Token. The token implementation was modelled after consolidation with the relevant stakeholders. This gives a good indication on how the token will be implemented in practice. The Hornet model will be described through all possible actor interactions, detailing the mechanisms governing these interactions.


### Third-party Services

#### Point of Sale (Medium of Exchange)

Businesses and events listed in the Hornet app can use Hornet as a point of sale for certain products, by using the LGBT Token. Users will be able to pay for events offered by businesses in their area with LGBT Tokens using their Hornet wallets. The identity SSO layer should ensure their privacy is maintained while purchasing goods tied to their identity, such as event tickets. This will also allow for the introduction of promotional events where a business could offer a small discount for users paying with LGBT Token through the Hornet app. One example would be the buying of drinks at specific events. For example, LGBT parties in San Paulo could allow for attendees to simply buy drinks throughout the night with their LGBT Tokens in their Hornet Wallet. This is beneficial for Hornet, as it encourages users to join the Hornet network for convenience and other financial rewards. Incorporating point of sale functionality into the Hornet app will contribute to the LGBT Token’s status as a medium-of-exchange token, where its utility is at least partially derived for the ability to conduct transactions for goods and services with it. Incorporating this functionality has a network effect, as driving early utility of the token for payments encourages other businesses to accept the token as a form of payment.

Several brick-and-mortar stores and venues around the world have already pledged to support the LGBT Token as a form of payment. The latest list of supporters can be viewed at https://lgbt-token.org/become-a-partner.



### LGBT Impact Program

#### Donations

Functionality should exist in the wallet which enables users to donate directly to a selection of charities forming part of the LGBT Impact Program. This should be as simple as selecting a “Donate” option within the wallet. This should take the user to a selection of charities. This selection can be adjusted to address the current needs and desires of the LGBT community. 

It is important to note that potential regulatory issues may arise as the donation scheme spans multiple geographic locations. The LGBT Foundation will commit to complying with all required regulation surrounding donations and restricting this functionality in jurisdictions where regulations prevent it. 


#### Voting

The LGBT Impact Program will have a quarterly vote for all token holders to vote on which charitable causes to fund. The list of causes will be provided by the Foundation initially, eventually the curation will be divested to a decentralized governance model where the community itself decides on appropriate programs to fund over time. This migration will occur as soon as a critical mass of users presents the ability to bootstrap a decentralized governance model. Any token holder will be able to submit a vote, where their vote weighting is a function of the amount of tokens in their wallet and how long these tokens have been held.

A few terms and variables are defined, which will be used to formulate the voting process:

* The soft cap of a charity is the minimum amount of currency a charity needs to earn the vote to qualify for a payout. This is due to the fact that certain charities require a minimum amount to function properly (such as for events, etc.).
* The hard cap of a charity is the maximum amount of currency a charity can be paid out in a vote. Charities are of various sizes and large donations to smaller charities are a suboptimal allocation of donations.
* The voting threshold, ![T](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20T), is the minimum amount of votes (or total vote-weight) required for a charity to qualify for payout. This is an adjustable parameter and should be chosen in such a way (for each vote and based on the number of charities available) that at least one charity will exceed ![T](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20T). 
* ![DVP](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20DVP) or dollar-per-vote is the amount of dollars each vote is worth and is calculated as the total amount available to be donated in the vote divided by the total amount of votes cast to charities that have exceeded the voting threshold required for a payout. 

The voting structure will work as follows:

* A selection of charities will be chosen for any token holder to be able to submit a vote from their wallet. A token holder’s wallet will consist of LGBT Tokens which have been deposited into the account at different times with ![n](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20n) different UTXOs (unspent transactions). Each UTXO ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i) can be represented as an amount deposited ![D_{i}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20D_%7Bi%7D) and a ‘time since deposited’ ![t_{i}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20t_%7Bi%7D) (i.e. ![(D, t_{i})](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%28D%2C%20t_%7Bi%7D%29)).
* The voting weight for this particular UTXO can then be calculated as 
![V_{i} = D_{i} \cdot \frac{t_{i}}{\alpha + \beta t_{i}}
](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20V_%7Bi%7D%20%3D%20D_%7Bi%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7Bt_%7Bi%7D%7D%7B%5Calpha%20&plus;%20%5Cbeta%20t_%7Bi%7D%7D) so that a token holder’s total vote weight is<br/>
![\sum _{i=1} ^{n} V_{i} = \sum _{i=1} ^{n} D_{i} \cdot \frac{t_{i}}{\alpha + \beta t_{i}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum%20_%7Bi%3D1%7D%20%5E%7Bn%7D%20V_%7Bi%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum%20_%7Bi%3D1%7D%20%5E%7Bn%7D%20D_%7Bi%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7Bt_%7Bi%7D%7D%7B%5Calpha%20&plus;%20%5Cbeta%20t_%7Bi%7D%7D)<br/>
Where _α, β_ are adjustable parameters with _α_ reflecting the growth rate of vote weight as a function of token “age” and _β_ reflecting how much the “age” of a token is weighted compared to the actual token amount. 

`` [[ CHART OF VOTE WEIGHT WITH DIFFERENT VALUES FOR β ]] ``

* Once the voting period has elapsed and vote weights calculated for each token holder, the votes are tallied for the charities. Let ![R = \{(C_{i},S_{i},H_{i})\}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R%20%3D%20%5C%7B%28C_%7Bi%7D%2CS_%7Bi%7D%2CH_%7Bi%7D%29%5C%7D) denote the set of (number of votes, soft cap, hard cap) of each charity with an ordered indexing ![i > j \Leftrightarrow C_{i} > C_{j}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i%20%3E%20j%20%5CLeftrightarrow%20C_%7Bi%7D%20%3E%20C_%7Bj%7D). We refer to charity ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i) as the charity with ![(number of votes, soft cap, hard cap) = (C_{i},S_{i},H_{i})](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%28number%20of%20votes%2C%20soft%20cap%2C%20hard%20cap%29%20%3D%20%28C_%7Bi%7D%2CS_%7Bi%7D%2CH_%7Bi%7D%29). All charities such that ![C_{i} < T](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20C_%7Bi%7D%20%3C%20T) are discarded from ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) as they did not receive enough votes. An iterated process ``HARD_CAP_PURGE`` now occurs:

  1. The ![DVP](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20DVP) is (re)calculated. 
  2. A preliminary payout ![P_{i} = C_{i} \cdot DPV](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20P_%7Bi%7D%20%3D%20C_%7Bi%7D%20%5Ccdot%20DPV) is determined for each charity ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i) still in ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R). 
  3. If ![P_{i} < H_{i}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20P_%7Bi%7D%20%3C%20H_%7Bi%7D) for every charity ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i) in ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R), terminate this process.
  4. For all charities ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i) such that ![P_{i} > H_{i}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20P_%7Bi%7D%20%3E%20H_%7Bi%7D), that charity is paid out ![H_{i}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20H_%7Bi%7D) and is removed from ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R).
  5. Return to step 1<br/><br/>
  We now have a set of charities ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) remaining who did not exceed their hard cap (those that did have already been paid out their hard caps). However, some of these charities may not have exceeded their soft caps. Since ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) is ordered-ascending in terms of votes we now iterate through the charities ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i):<br/><br/>
  6. (Re)calculate the ![DVP](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20DVP).
  7. Calculate ![P_{i}=C_{i} \cdot DVP](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20P_%7Bi%7D%3DC_%7Bi%7D%20%5Ccdot%20DVP) each charity ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i) starting from the lowest ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i). For each ![i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20i), if ![P_{i}>S_{i}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20P_%7Bi%7D%3ES_%7Bi%7D), pay out that charity and remove it from ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R). Do this until a charity is found such that ![S_{i} > P_{i}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20S_%7Bi%7D%20%3E%20P_%7Bi%7D) (or until ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) is empty). Remove this charity from ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) but do not pay out since it did not reach its soft cap.
  8. If ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) is empty, terminate this process.
  9. Reapply the process ``HARD_CAP_PURGE`` to the remaining charities in ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) since they may now have exceeded their hard cap with the additional funds from the removed charity being distributed.
  10. Return to step 6 if ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) is non-empty.

We believe this process fairly allocates proportional funds to all qualifying (i.e. votes exceeding ![T](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20T)) charities while taking into account hard and soft caps. Every time a qualifying charity is removed for exceeding a hard cap or falling below a soft cap, the additional funds available mean the new potential rewards for the remaining charities need to be recalculated. Out of the charities which did not meet their soft caps, determining which to remove first is done based on number of votes (i.e. the one with the lowest votes is removed first), with their potential earnings being redistributed and potentially allowing other charities with more votes to meet their soft cap.

The voting itself will not be done in a decentralized manner, at least not initially. The LGBT Foundation – as a trusted entity which manages the privacy of identity of users interacting in the network – will manage the voting separately using an acceptable [E2E-type voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems) format, such as [Helios](https://heliosvoting.org/), which preserves the anonymity of users as much as possible while guaranteeing integrity of the votes.


### Users

#### Pay as you go (PAYG) for Hornet Premium

A PAYG model will be introduced, which will allow for existing subscription packages in addition to more granular choices of Hornet membership. The base price of Hornet Premium for a month is characterized as ![\$x/hour](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5C%24x/hour). Hornet will introduce a continuous price function to allow someone to purchase the below durations of Hornet membership. This price function is guided by the following price points (guided by the philosophy that ‘buying in bulk’ should be cheaper per hour):

 * Annual package - Hornet costs $0.007 per hour ~ ($5/month)
 * Quarterly package - Hornet costs $0.01 per hour ~ ($7/month)
 * Monthly package - Hornet costs $0.014 per hour ~ ($10/month)
 * Weekly package - Hornet costs $0.03 per hour ~ ($5/week)
 * Daily package - Hornet costs $0.1 per hour ~ ($2.4/day)
 * Hourly package - Hornet costs $0.5 per hour ~ ($0.5/hour)

Based on these guiding points the following Hornet Premium pricing model is proposed, where people can purchase Hornet Premium for any amount of hours h:

![\$/hour Price(h) = \lambda h^{-\mu}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5C%24/hour%20Price%28h%29%20%3D%20%5Clambda%20h%5E%7B-%5Cmu%7D)

Where ![\lambda, \mu](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Clambda%2C%20%5Cmu) are adjustable parameters. Using the above points as a guide, this produces the following price multiplier function:

![\$/hour Price(h) = 0.4459h^{-0.49}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5C%24/hour%20Price%28h%29%20%3D%200.4459h%5E%7B-0.49%7D)

`` [[ CHART: PRICE OF HORNET PREMIUM AS A FUNCTION OF HOURS PURCHASED ]] ``

This incentivizes purchasing for longer periods, but allows users to purchase any amount of Hornet Premium at a time.

#### Community Rewards

Hornet has an existing community rewards program which will be incorporating the LGBT Token network and expanded to provide rewards for a variety of behaviors. Actions which have been identified as reward-generators are:

 * Moderating the Hornet platform. This includes reporting bad or inappropriate behavior and becoming a part of the designated moderation team.
 * Referring new users to Hornet. People can be invited to Hornet by existing users who receive a reward if the user signs up and verifies their account. 
 * A ‘first’ action for certain types of actions will generate rewards, such as submitting your first story. This incentivizes user participation in the network.
 * There may be rewards for reaching follower milestones. This is applied to both users and content creators.

| Action | Perk |
| ------ | ---- |
| Claiming a Hornet wallet (for LGBT Tokens) | 1 LGBT Token per user. ~ 5 million LGBT Tokens have been allocated to encourage widespread adoption of the wallet. |
| Community Rewards (today): Moderators; Translators; Beta testers; City ambassadors; Stories; Hornet guys | Currently users rewarded perk points. Users can redeem these points in the Hornet shop. The early version of the shop contains 7 items. |
| Community Rewards (amplified); All of the above +; Influencer; Traveller; Party starter; Host | Users will now instead receive LGBT Tokens.; The community rewards will be aggressively increased by 10x  through the use of the LGBT Token. Increase diversity of rewards program; The increase is considered sustainable as currently approximately; |
| Profile Completion | The Hornet team is exploring building out rewards for users who complete their profile. It is proven that profiles which are completed have higher activity. Thus, Hornet may choose to incentive profile completion using the LGBT Token. However, Hornet will decide how and when this is done. |
| Profile Verification | As above, genuine profiles are more valuable to Hornet than fake accounts, so in future Hornet may incentivize profile verification. |


#### Hornet Attainment

Hornet Attainment is a service which will be available to users in some Asian regions. Users will have a ‘reputation score’ which reflects their social status in the network. Users can show appreciation to influential users by gifting them virtual goods that are purchased with LGBT Tokens. When these goods are sent to the recipient, 50% of the LGBT Token value is reflected in their wallet as ‘attainment’ tokens. These tokens count towards their reputation score using the formula below. The other 50% is reflected as Hornet revenue. Hornet attainment is not designed to be lucrative for users, but rather for users to accrue reputation points. Recipients who hold their attainment tokens, instead of cashing them out, will earn reputation points based on the value of these tokens as well as how long these tokens have been held.  For ‘attainment’ tokens with an LGBT Token value ![G](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20G) having been held for time ![t](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20t), the reputation points ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) accrued are:

![R(G,t) = \rho \cdot G \cdot \frac{\alpha - t}{\beta - t}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R%28G%2Ct%29%20%3D%20%5Crho%20%5Ccdot%20G%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha%20-%20t%7D%7B%5Cbeta%20-%20t%7D)

where ![\alpha](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Calpha), ![\beta](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbeta), ![\varrho](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cvarrho) are configurable parameters. ![0 < \alpha < \beta](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%200%20%3C%20%5Calpha%20%3C%20%5Cbeta) and these are used to determine how quickly the value of ![R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20R) decays over time. ![\varrho](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cvarrho) is used to scale the reputation.

Note the starting value may be different for different values of ![\alpha](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Calpha) but this can just be rescaled by ![\varrho](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cvarrho).

Users can also show off these gifts in a virtual trophy case. Reputation may also include tangible benefits such as visibility in a certain area for Hornet social matches.

### Content Creators

#### Monetization

To incentivize both the presence of content creators (to choose Hornet as a content platform), network interactions and higher quality content, a monetization scheme for content creators will be introduced. Every fixed time interval, the monetization for a content creator should be calculated and once this exceeds a certain threshold, it should be deposited into their LGBT Token wallet. When calculating the monetization at a later time interval for content which has already been monetized, the mechanism takes into account that only additional interactions which haven’t previously been accounted for in monetization, should be used.

Monetization should be based on a variety of factors and scale appropriately, while ensuring it cannot be abused by smaller or larger content creators:

 * How many likes a post receives should influence the monetization scheme. This should be tempered by the fact that for larger content creators, followers will correlate with likes, so the ratio ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cfrac%7Blikes%7D%7Bfollowers%7D) is a more appropriate metric.
 * Similarly to how many likes, the number of shares should influence the monetization, using a similar ratio as defined in the previous point. For each action such as share, like etc., an ‘effort’ factor should be used to determine how many likes or shares are appropriate for the monetization threshold, to discourage abuse.
 * There should be a threshold which a particular monetization calculation needs to exceed to be considered a monetization (so if you have one follow and one like, for example, there is no monetization for that post). 

We define the following variables:

 * ![f](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20f) is the number of followers a content creator has.
 * ![g](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20g) is a growth rate factor determining how payout scales with more followers.
 * ![l](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20l) is the number of likes a content creator receives for a given post.
 * ![s](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20s) is the number of times a content creators post is shared.
 * ![\alpha_{l}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Calpha_%7Bl%7D) is a scaling parameter for likes to scale it down to a payout (since 10,000 likes should not pay out 10,000 LGBT Tokens). This is determined as a network parameter based on how likely the average user will like something.
 * Similarly, ![\alpha_{s}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Calpha_%7Bs%7D) is a scaling parameter for shares.
 * ![\varrho](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cvarrho) is a general scaling factor used to adjust the entire payout function.

The monetization ![M_{n}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20M_%7Bn%7D) at time interval n for a particular content creator’s post (which was created at time interval ![m](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20m)) is then

![M_n = \rho \cdot \frac{\alpha_ll + \alpha_ss}{\sqrt{f^g}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?M_n%20%3D%20%5Crho%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha_ll%20&plus;%20%5Calpha_ss%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bf%5Eg%7D%7D)

`` [[ CHART PAYOUT IN TOKENS x NUMBERS OF FOLLOWERS ]] ``

The actual payout ![M](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20M) for a particular post should be computed as: 

![M = max\left(M_n - \displaystyle\sum_{i=m}^{n-1}M_i,0\right)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?M%20%3D%20max%5Cleft%28M_n%20-%20%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum_%7Bi%3Dm%7D%5E%7Bn-1%7DM_i%2C0%5Cright%29)

(where ![M_{i}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20M_%7Bi%7D) in the sum are the actual payouts of previous time intervals) so that previous likes and shares are not double-counted. If this is below zero (such that if followers are lost, or posts are unliked), then the payout becomes zero (as opposed to becoming negative). This is accumulated if it exceeds ![T](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20T). The formula can effectively be calculated by subtracting the total amount paid out for a post up to time period ![n-1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20n-1) from ![M_{n}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20M_%7Bn%7D).

Part of Hornet’s go-to-market strategy is to target content creators within a specific geographic area. Hornet may supercharge content creator incentives within specific geographic areas to encourage such local growth.

#### Generalization to various actions with multipliers

If multiple interactions are introduced which allow users to interact with content creators, these can all be included in a monetization function with their own scalings (since the rate at which each action is used can vary significantly - people often like more than they share, for example).

Assume there is a set of actions ![A = \left \{ {A_i} \right \}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20A%20%3D%20%5Cleft%20%5C%7B%20%7BA_i%7D%20%5Cright%20%5C%7D) (such as likes, shares, etc) with an associated set of payout multipliers ![\left \{{\alpha_i}\right \}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cleft%20%5C%7B%7B%5Calpha_i%7D%5Cright%20%5C%7D). Let the cardinality of ![A](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20A) be ![C](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20C). Then

![M_n = \frac{\rho}{\sqrt{f^g}}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^C\alpha_iA_i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?M_n%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Crho%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bf%5Eg%7D%7D%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EC%5Calpha_iA_i)

Alternative distribution models for launch partner to explore, but which were not deemed suitable for Hornet, are described in Appendix A. 


### Other Implementations

#### Credit Card

A credit card is expected to be introduced by the Foundation that enables users to receive LGBT Token as a form of cash-back rewards on FIAT purchases. Users can decide whether these rewards are directed towards causes or toward their wallet. This is expected to be implemented within 18 months. This will allow tokens to be earned by users, which can be spent wherever LGBT Tokens are accepted and to overcome one of the main obstacles for the mainstream audience to acquire cryptocurrencies in general. A credit card that establishes an automatic LGBT Token distribution towards users while being usable on everyday transactions might create a significant demand to buy back Tokens for the Card issuer<sup>othe-1</sup>.

The LGBT Token rebates on purchases using the credit card will be based on a levelled system consisting of tiers. An early draft of the system is shown below:

| Amount of LGBT Token spent over 12 months | 0 - 999 | 1,000- 4,999 | 5,000- 9,999 | 10,000+ |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ | -------- | ----- |
| Your reward level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| | Rabate rates | | |
| Hornet purchases | 0.5% | 0.7% | 0.9% | 1% |
| LGBT affiliated events | 0.2% | 0.4% | 0.7% | 1% |
| Shopping | 0.1% | 0.2% | 0.5% | 0.8% |


## Token Technical Design

### Design Objectives

Design objectives help guide us toward a set of desired characteristics for the token that will both benefit and empower the LGBT community. Currently, we examine the overarching design objectives that can all be perceived as key ingredients to the success of the LGBT Token:


### LGBT Token transaction pseudonymity

As discussed in the token objectives, we want the LGBT Token transactions to be anonymous.

Furthermore, expecting LGBT members to be willing to expose their entire transaction histories on a public blockchain is a level of hyper-transparency that is not currently commonplace. For example, one's bank knows one's transaction history, but the history is not known by all stores where the account's linked credit card has been used.


### LGBT Token transaction scalability

We would need to build our token on a blockchain platform that offers a likely path to high throughout transaction scaling. Once global mass adoption of the LGBT Token happens, it is critical to be supported by a blockchain ecosystem that is able to handle this increased level of network activity. Scalability influences both transaction fees and the time taken to confirm transactions.


### LGBT Token functionality

This refers to the scope of the token’s use. Simple token functionality implies that we can only use the token for transfers and it would function purely as a medium-of-exchange. More complex token functionality requires that a token can be used in a smart contract environment. Here, tokens fulfil numerous use-cases beyond simple transfers. Ideally, LGBT Tokens should be able to incorporate smart contract functionality.


### LGBT Token decentralization

This refers to the extent to which the system cannot be controlled or significantly influenced by any single or small group of users. Since we want this token to be governed by the LGBT community and not just a few powerful stakeholders, decentralization is of the utmost importance. Furthermore, decentralization presents a more robust architecture that doesn’t contain a few central points of weakness which are susceptible to attack. Most blockchains are inherently decentralized, however different consensus protocols – amongst other factors – greatly influence the degree of decentralization and this should thus be carefully considered. 

The LGBT Foundation deems the technical design objectives to have the following ranking: 

`` Pseudonymity > Decentralization > Scalability > Functionality ``

Finally, we note that there is **no** design objective which aims at pioneering blockchain technology development. The LGBT Token will instead focus on harnessing currently available blockchain technology to further the economic and social goals of the LGBT community. When new blockchain technology solutions aligning with this mission become available, they will be integrated into the system. This is encompassed in ‘ecosystem support’ in Table `x` below.

## Platform Comparison

### Platforms under consideration

Numerous blockchain platforms were analyzed. The following platforms were explored: Ethereum, Stellar, Waves, EOS, Simple Token, NEO, Tezos, Cardano and Rchain. Emphasis was placed on privacy and scalability of these platforms and the technology surrounding these considerations.

We explored many interesting scaling solutions, such as Raiden, Sharding, Plasma, leased proof-of-stake and recursive snarks. We reviewed production timelines along with the technology underpinning these solutions. The Raiden network showed great promise for LGBT Tokens and it provided some degree of anonymity, which we discuss later. Platforms such as Stellar already show sufficient scalability, albeit at the cost of decentralization and functionality.

Regarding privacy, we initially explored high-tech solutions that serve to completely obfuscate transaction history through advanced cryptographic techniques. Zero-knowledge proofs were one such technique. Although theoretically bulletproof, we found these techniques not to be production-ready. We also examined low-tech solutions that use clever combinations of cryptographic hashes, signatures and other interesting mechanisms to obfuscate transaction trails. The idea of creating an in-house mixing service shows particular promise for the LGBT Token.

Drawing on the above insights, we compared two platforms that we believe align with the vision of the LGBT Token. These platforms are the Stellar and Ethereum platforms. The motivations for these platforms are twofold. First, both platforms are currently production-ready. Secondly, and more importantly, both platforms plan to integrate payment channels into the network by Q4-2018: Ethereum through the [Raiden network](https://raiden.network/) and [Stellar through the Lightning network](https://www.stellar.org/blog/2018-Stellar-Roadmap/). The Raiden and Lightning networks refer roughly to the same technology known as payment channels. Payment channels will likely provide the necessary degree of scalability and privacy required by the LGBT Token.

Next, we briefly compare Ethereum and Stellar as they exist today and then again in Q4-2018, when we believe payment channels will be integrated into both platforms. Table 1 scores both platforms by a scoring (out of 10) and weighting individual platform aspects based on their importance to the LGBT Token network. Next, Table 2 briefly outlines the differences between the platforms in these chosen criteria, motivating the scores found in Table `x`.

|  | Weight | Ethereum Q1/2018 | Ethereum with Raiden Q4/2018 | Stellar Q1/2018 | Stellar with Lightning network Q4/2018 |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Privacy                    |    25%   |   3   |    8    |    2    |    6    |
| Scalability                |    15%   |   3   |    7    |    7    |    9    |

`Table x: Matrix ranking: Ethereum vs. Stellar in Q1-2018 vs. Q4-2018.` 
<br>
<br>

| | Ethereum | Stellar |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Privacy:** The degree to which users can transact anonymously. | Pseudo-anonymous. Payment channels introduce an acceptable level of anonymity. Active research by Ethereum Foundation into high-tech zero-knowledge privacy solutions. | Pseudo-anonymous. Payment channels introduce an acceptable level of anonymity. |
| **Scalability:** Limits on the number of transactions the network can process. | Currently, around 15 transactions per second. Payment channels enable unlimited near instantaneous off-chain transfers between connected parties. This result will be suitable to handle mass LGBT Token adoption. | Currently, around 1,000 transactions per second. Payment channels and protocol advances will improve scalability. Stellar still falls significantly short of Visa or Mastercard, etc. at 20,000 transactions per second. |
| Decentralization: The extent to which the system cannot be controlled by any single user. | Anyone can run a node and validate transactions. No significant barrier to entry of running a node. | Anyone can run a Stellar Core node and validate transactions (although significant barrier to entry when compared to Ethereum). There is less incentive to run a full node as no mining fees collected. Inherently Stellar has fewer validators and, thus, a greater degree of centralization. |
| **Transaction fees and speed** | Median transaction confirmation speed: 3.5 minutes. Transaction fees depend on computation complexity, speed of the transaction, amongst other variables. Median fee: US$0.069  per transaction. Payment channels enable negligible off-chain transfer fees and near instantaneous transfers. | Median transaction confirmation speed: 5 seconds. Negligible fees:  US$0.000002 per operation in each transaction. |
| **Functionality:** i.e. does the platform allow full smart contract functionality? | Almost any conceivable and programmable application as Ethereum is Turing-complete. | Largely restricted to payments and a small library of other abstractions. Very limited functionality. |
| **Ecosystem support** | A large community of actively contributing developers and a strong network of support. | Growing number of developers and a growing network of support. |

`Table x: Comparing Ethereum to Stellar`

### Ethereum vs. Stellar 

As it currently stands, Ethereum and Stellar each present unique strengths and weaknesses. Ethereum displays a good degree of decentralization, strong functionality and a promising outlook regarding privacy. However, Ethereum has relatively high transaction fees and long transaction confirmation times. Stellar, on the other hand, facilitates fast and cheap transactions. Unfortunately, this comes with the opportunity cost of decentralization and a lack of complete smart contract functionality.  

Table 1 shows that based on these insights we currently score Ethereum 5/10 overall while Stellar receives a score of 4.5/10. These scores reflect the fact that Ethereum scores better on the critical design features needed for the LGBT Token – decentralization and privacy – which are more heavily weighted when calculating the final score.

When payment channels are integrated into both Stellar and Ethereum – in the form of the Raiden and Lighting networks – we see Ethereum move even further ahead. Table 1 shows Ethereum’s new overall score of 7.9/10 compared to Stellar's 6.4/10. The greater jump in score for Ethereum highlights that Ethereum has more to gain from payment channel integration. This is because Stellar is already relatively scalable, whilst Ethereum is currently not. The introduction of payment channels in Ethereum will facilitate near-instant, low-fee transactions, remedying Ethereum's current high-fee and slow transaction speed shortfall. 

The superior current and future scoring of Ethereum in Table 1 reflects our sentiment that Ethereum is the best technology platform to use when creating and issuing the LGBT Token. It satisfies all major requirements of the LGBT Token. Beyond this, Ethereum has a very active community working on numerous platform improvements (zk-SNARK, Raiden, etc.) that will further benefit the LGBT Token. Although Stellar shows promise, its lack of decentralization positions it as a compromised second-choice solution.

### Platform Conclusion

We found Ethereum to perform better in the areas of decentralization, privacy and functionality. Stellar performed best in scalability exhibiting high-speed and low-fee transactions. Since privacy and decentralization are the key requirements of the LGBT Token, this positions Ethereum as the leading platform.

In the near future, when payment channels are integrated into both platforms, we find that Ethereum stands to benefit more from these near-instant, low-fee and scalable transactions. In light of this analysis, Ethereum emerges as the preferred platform to use for building and issuing the LGBT Token.
